Andrews,  J.,  denied  competitor's\nmotion for judgment as matter of law (JMOL), or in alternative, for new trial, and added prejudgment interest to damages\naward. Competitor appealed.\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Chen, Circuit Judge, held that:\n\n[1] competitor was not prejudiced by court not construing phrase, “switched telecommunication system,” to exclude any\nelement of data-gram-based system;\n\n[2] jury reasonably could have determined in its infringement finding that “a call destination” claim did not require\ndestination to be final point on path of call, but could be more than one destination;\n\n[3] jury reasonably could have determined in its infringement finding that phrase “identifier of a second party” did not\nrequire “unique identifier of a second party”;\n\n[4] competitor waived any arguments for consideration on motion for judgment as a matter of law concerning how it\nwas prejudiced by broader construction of “parsing”;\n\n[5] patentee did not exclude processes such as “mapping,” “lookup,” and “translating” from “parsing”; and\n\n[6] prejudgment interest ran from earliest date of infringement for any patent issued at time of hypothetical negotiation,\nand  thus  prejudgment  interest  did  not  have  to  be  apportioned,  although  some  patents  had  not  issued  at  time  of\nhypothetical negotiation.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

The panel decision here in no way departs from the proper construction\nof Rule 19.\n\nRule 19(a) provides the procedural mechanism by which a party can join necessary parties. It applies if, “in [a] person's\nabsence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties....” Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(1). It goes on to provide\nthat: “If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who\nrefuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.” Fed.R.Civ.P.\n19(a)(2).\n\nRule 19 by its terms presupposes the existing parties' substantive entitlement to “relief” from another source of law. It\ntherefore does not authorize compulsory  *1353  joinder when the plaintiff has no substantive right to relief without the\nconsent of that person, i.e., where the right can be asserted only jointly, not unilaterally by the plaintiff. In that situation,\nwithout the absent person's consent, the existing plaintiff has no right to “relief” to which Rule 19 applies.\n\nA contrary view of Rule 19 would overstep the boundaries of congressional authorization. Procedural rules cannot be\nused to abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right. 28 U.S.C. § 2072; see also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor,\n521 U.S. 591, 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997) (“[R]ules of procedure ‘shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right.’ ” (quoting § 2072)). Where, as here, there is a substantive right not to join in the assertion of the\nplaintiff's claim, Rule 19(a) does not apply. Applying the Rule both to compel joinder as a party and on that basis to\nallow assertion of the infringement claim, as STC.UNM argues, would abridge the rights of the joined party and enlarge\nthe rights of the initial plaintiff.\n\nIn other contexts, courts have read Rule 19 as authorizing involuntary joinder of plaintiffs only if the proposed plaintiff\nis substantively obligated to join. Caprio v. Wilson, for example, explained that joinder of involuntary plaintiffs was\nintended for circumstances in which there was a trust relationship between the plaintiff and involuntary co-plaintiff,\nobligating the involuntary co-plaintiff to allow its name to be used in the suit. 513 F.2d 837, 839–40 (9th Cir.1975).\nWhen that trust or contractual relationship is lacking, courts have declined to allow plaintiffs to involuntarily join other\nplaintiffs. See, e.g., Diagnostic Unit Inmate Council v. Films, Inc., 88 F.3d 651, 654 (8th Cir.1996) (Arkansas Department\nof Corrections could not be joined as involuntary plaintiff under Rule 19(a) because it “has no obligation, contractual or\notherwise, to allow the inmates to use its name to secure declaratory judgment relief” in copyright infringement action);\nCaprio, 513 F.2d at 839–40 (Post Office could not be joined as involuntary plaintiff because there was no trust relationship\nbetween appellant and the Post Office who each had an “independent right”); Coast v. Hunt Oil Co., 195 F.2d 870, 871–\n72 (5th Cir.1952) (no involuntary joinder of partner with 51% interest under Rule 19(a)).\n\nFor these reasons, the decision in this case fully comports with Rule 19. That Rule, as its authorizing statute requires,\ndirects the inquiry to the nature of the underlying substantive rights. It does not alter the scope of those rights. It is\nsubstantive patent law, not Rule 19, that answers the dispositive question here: whether one co-owner may unilaterally\nenforce a patent, without the consent of other co-owners.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n2\n\n\x0cSTC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 767 F.3d 1351 (2014)\n112 U.S.P.Q.2d 1294\n\nAs to that underlying substantive-rights question, precedent has long provided a clear answer. This court has consistently\nrecognized that the substantive right to enforce the patent does not belong unilaterally to each co-owner, but requires\nall  of  the  co-owners'  agreement,  so  that  each  co-owner  has  a  substantive  right  not  to  be  involuntarily  joined  in  a\npatent infringement suit without such agreement. See, e.g., Ethicon, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 135 F.3d 1456, 1468\n(Fed.Cir.1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 923, 119 S.Ct. 278, 142 L.Ed.2d 229 (1998) (“[A]s a matter of substantive patent law,\nall co-owners must ordinarily consent to join as plaintiffs in an infringement suit.”); Schering Corp. v. Roussel–UCLAF\nSA, 104 F.3d 341, 345 (Fed.Cir.1997) (“Ordinarily, one co-owner has the right to impede the other co-owner's ability to\nsue infringers by refusing to voluntarily join in such a suit.” (citing  *1354  Willingham v. Lawton, 555 F.2d 1340, 1344\n(6th Cir.1977))); DDB Techs., L.L.C. v. MLB Advanced Media, L.P., 517 F.3d 1284, 1289 n. 2 (Fed.Cir.2008) (“[W]e\nhave explicitly held that Rule 19 does not permit the involuntary joinder of a patent co-owner in an infringement suit\nbrought by another co-owner.” (citing Ethicon, 135 F.3d at 1468)); Taylor v. Taylor Made Plastics, Inc., 565 Fed.Appx.\n888, 889 (Fed.Cir.2014) (“If any co-owner should refuse to join as a co-plaintiff, the suit must be dismissed for lack of\nstanding.”) (citation omitted); Israel Bio–Eng'g Project v. Amgen, Inc., 475 F.3d 1256, 1264–65 (Fed.Cir.2007) ( “Absent\nthe voluntary joinder of all co-owners of a patent, a co-owner acting alone will lack standing.”) (citation omitted); Gal–\nOr v. U.S., 470 Fed.Appx. 879, 884 (Fed.Cir.2012) (same).\n\nThe panel dissent and the dissents from the denial of rehearing en banc do not point to any case law that, contrary to\nthis consistent line of precedent, imposes a substantive obligation on a patent co-owner to consent to the assertion of an\ninfringement claim or, therefore, to join an infringement suit absent an agreement or implied agreement to join. Case law\nindicating that Rule 19 is available to an owner to join a co-owner under circumstances in which there is an agreement\nby  the  co-owner  to  join, 1   or  available  to  someone  who,  by  agreement,  is  an  exclusive  licensee, 2   only  underscores\nthe importance of absent owners' consent to joinder. Under circumstances in which a plaintiff has a contractual right\nto unilaterally enforce the patent, Rule 19 unremarkably allows that plaintiff to join involuntary plaintiffs. Without\nagreement, no precedent has held that a co-owner may be involuntarily joined. 3\n\nSection 262 as long construed provides a foundation for the consistent conclusion that an individual co-owner has no\nunilateral substantive right to enforce a patent, i.e., that another co-owner has a substantive right not to be involuntarily\njoined in enforcing the patent. Section 262 provides that, absent agreement to the contrary by the patent holders, each\npatent  holder  has  the  right  to  unilaterally  practice  the  patent.  35  U.S.C.  §  262. 4   That  right,  both  before  and  after\nenactment of the provision, has been consistently interpreted to include the unilateral right to grant another a license to\npractice the patent, see Shum v. Intel Corp., 629 F.3d 1360, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2010); Schering, 104 F.3d at 344; Willingham,\n555  F.2d  at  1344  (“It  has  been  held  that  a  co-owner  of  a  patent  can  even  grant  a  license  to  a  third  party  without\nconsent of the other owners and neither the co-owner-licensor nor the third-  *1355  party-licensee is liable to the other\nowners. Talbot v. Quaker–State Oil Refining, 104 F.2d 967 (3d Cir.1939); Bendix Aviation Corp. v. Kury, 88 F.Supp. 243\n(E.D.N.Y.1950). See Aberdeen Hosiery Mills Co. v. Kaufman, 96 U.S.P.Q. 133 (E.D.N.Y.1953).”). If a co-owner can\nunilaterally license third parties, it follows that such a co-owner may decline to sue for infringement, and another co-\nowner may not unilaterally sue for infringement. Hence the longstanding recognition that “[o]rdinarily, one co-owner\nhas the right to impede the other co-owner's ability to sue infringers by refusing to voluntarily join in such a suit.”\nSchering, 104 F.3d at 345.\n\nChanging this court's approach would disrupt settled precedent of this court, which has not been drawn into question\nby the Supreme Court. That precedent provides a clear definition of substantive rights that may, then, be altered by\ncontract. The value of stability is especially great for such rights. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 233, 129 S.Ct.\n808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). Moreover, allowing involuntary joinder of co-owners might compel them to incur attorney's\nfees, subject them to sanctions in exceptional cases under § 285, and disrupt established business relationships with the\ndefendant or related parties.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Changing that rule would upset settled expectations. There is\nno reason for en banc review.\n\nNEWMAN, Circuit Judge, with whom LOURIE, O'MALLEY, and WALLACH, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from\nthe denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\nThe University of New Mexico (through its licensing arm STC.UNM) and the Sandia Corporation are joint owners of\nthe patents in suit, which STC seeks to enforce against Intel Corporation. A split panel of this court held that such an\ninfringement suit cannot proceed, because Sandia has not joined in the suit, and cannot be involuntarily joined despite\nFederal Rule 19 and its provisions for involuntary joinder of a necessary party. The Rule includes:\n\nRule 19. Required Joinder of Parties\n\n(a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.\n\n(1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:\n\n(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties....\n\n....\n\n(1) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made\na party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary\nplaintiff.\n\nRule 19 is not permissive—yet this court holds that Rule 19 uniquely does not apply in patent cases. The court today\ndenies STC's petition for en banc review, confirming this further removal of patent causes from the mainstream of the\nlaw. I previously commented on this flawed direction, see STC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d 940, 947 (Fed.Cir.2014)\n(Newman, J., dissenting), and write again to stress the constitutional and statutory and common law principles that are\nviolated by withdrawal of disputes from judicial resolution. When access to the courts is barred, a foundation of the\nnation is eroded. The Court has observed:\n\nFreedom of access to the courts is a cherished value in our democratic society.... The courts provide\nthe mechanism  *1356  for the peaceful resolution of disputes that might otherwise give rise to\nattempts at self-help. There is, and should be, the strongest presumption of open access to all levels\nof the judicial system.\n\nTalamini v. Allstate Ins. Co., 470 U.S. 1067, 1070–71, 105 S.Ct. 1824, 85 L.Ed.2d 125 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have “the force of a federal statute,” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 13, 61\nS.Ct. 422, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941). Here Sandia, as patent co-owner, is necessary to the infringement suit in order to protect\nthe defendant from separate suits for the same transgression. Sandia is within the district court's jurisdiction, is subject\nto process, and can readily be joined.\n\nThe requirement that all co-owners must be included in a patent enforcement action flows from the common law, where\nthe Court explained in Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 11 S.Ct. 334, 34 L.Ed. 923 (1891), that in order to protect\ndefendants from multiple suits by owners of “an undivided part or share” of the patent, all such owners should be included\nin suit enforcing the patent:\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Intel Corp., 767 F.3d 1351 (2014)\n112 U.S.P.Q.2d 1294\n\nThe  monopoly  thus  granted  is  one  entire  thing,  and  cannot  be  divided  into  parts,  except  as\nauthorized by those laws. The patentee or his assigns may, by instrument in writing, assign, grant,\nand convey, either (1) the whole patent, comprising the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the\ninvention throughout the United States; or (2) an undivided part or share of that exclusive right; or\n(3) the exclusive right under the patent within and throughout a specified part of the United States.\n\n138 U.S. 252, 255, 11 S.Ct. 334, 34 L.Ed. 923 (1891); see also Indep. Wireless Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of Am., 269 U.S.\n459, 474, 46 S.Ct. 166, 70 L.Ed. 357 (1926) (noting that joinder of all entities with a right of enforcement averts multiple\nsuits for the same acts).\n\nIn turn, the patent statute has codified the rights of joint owners of patents, each to have full enjoyment of the patent\nright (absent contrary agreement). Such enjoyment includes the right to exclude. Article III states the judicial obligation\nto assure these rights:\n\n[U]nder Article III, Congress established courts to adjudicate cases and controversies as to claims of\ninfringement of individual rights whether by unlawful action of private persons or by the exertion\nof unauthorized administrative power.\n\nStark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 310, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944).\n\nThe Federal Rules state the procedural foundations of the processes of law. The unique exclusion of patent cases from\nFederal Rule 19 is as peculiar as it is unjustified. See Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102,\n88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968) (discussing the criteria for necessary parties to litigation).\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are “in every pertinent respect, as binding as any statute duly enacted by Congress,\nand federal courts have no more discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate than they do to disregard constitutional or\nstatutory provisions.” Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 255, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988);\nsee also, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2072; Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 406–07, 130 S.Ct.\n1431, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010).\n\nThe Federal Rules have consistently been applied to facilitate judicial dispute resolution, to settle legal controversies—not\nto bar aggrieved persons from access  *1357  to judicial attention. “Under the Rules, the impulse is toward entertaining\nthe broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties; joinder of claims, parties and remedies is\nstrongly encouraged.” United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 724, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966); see also\nFed. Res. Corp. v. Shoni Uranium Corp., 408 F.2d 875, 877–78 (10th Cir.1969) (“To obtain this result [of an adjudication\nbinding on all interested persons] is the very purpose of Rule 19 and reflects the true interest of all litigants, both state\nand federal courts, and, indeed, the public itself. Legal controversies should be settled, when possible, in whole and not\nthrough multiple litigation.” (citing Provident Tradesmens Bank, 390 U.S. at 108, 88 S.Ct. 733)).\n\nNo justification can be found for withdrawing or excluding the co-owner of a patent from access to legal process. Section\n281  of  Title  35  provides  that  “A  patentee  shall  have  remedy  by  civil  action  for  infringement  of  his  patent.”  Rights\nin patent property as between joint owners are the rights of owners “in common,” Pitts v.

Corp., 718 F.2d 603, 606 (3d Cir.1983) (“[W]e must ask, first,\nwhether [employer] had a duty to permit [plaintiff] to use its name to protect the rights asserted in the action....”); Caprio v.\nWilson, 513 F.2d 837, 839–40 (9th Cir.1975) (“[A]uthorization in Rule 19(a) to join a party as an involuntary plaintiff may\nbe invoked only when the party sought to be joined has a duty to allow plaintiff to use his name in the action.” (quotation\nomitted)). For patent cases, to facilitate 35 U.S.C. § 281 (“A patentee shall have remedy by civil action for infringement\nof his patent.”), Rule 19 implements the duty discussed in Independent Wireless, for joinder in an action brought by the\nexclusive licensee arises because the patent owner\n\nholds the title to the patent in trust for such a licensee, to the extent that he must allow the use of his\nname as plaintiff in any action brought at the instance of the licensee in law or in equity to obtain\ndamages for the injury to his exclusive right by an infringer, or to enjoin infringement of it....\n\n269 U.S. at 459, 46 S.Ct. 166. Likewise, patent owners in common have a similar duty to avoid waste of the property\nthey own in common. Rule 19 provides a simple procedure for implementing that right, while continuing to protect the\ndefendant.\n\n*1358  This court holds that a party who is necessary to the action cannot be joined, and therefore that the action cannot\nproceed. Yet our constitutional framework provides for resolution of property disputes through judicial attention. An\narbitrary rule that excludes enforcement of a property right that is owned in common, cannot be reconciled with the\nprinciples of the rule of law. At a minimum, this ruling should be reviewed by the en banc court, not tacitly confirmed.\n\nO'MALLEY, Circuit Judge, with whom NEWMAN, LOURIE, and WALLACH, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from\nthe denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\nThe panel majority “holds that the right of a patent co-owner to impede an infringement suit brought by another co-owner\nis a substantive right that trumps the procedural rule for involuntary joinder under Rule 19(a)” of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. STC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 754 F.3d 940, 946 (Fed.Cir.2014). It reaches this conclusion, however, without\nadequately explaining the legal footing upon which it is premised. It fails to ground its holding in either federal common\nlaw or the provisions of the Patent Act and ignores the mandatory nature of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nSeveral things are clear about Rule 19. First, Rule 19(a)(1)(A) provides that “[a] person who is subject to service of\nprocess and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if in that\nperson's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded). Second, Rule 19, like all other Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is “as binding as any federal statute.” Stone\nContainer Corp. v. United States, 229 F.3d 1345, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2000) (“[T]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, like\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal procedure, are ‘as binding as any federal statute.’ ”) (quoting Bank of Nova Scotia v.\nUnited States, 487 U.S. 250, 255, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988)). Third, again, like all other Rules of Civil\nProcedure, Rule 19 applies in patent cases just as fully as it applies in all other federal civil actions. See, e.g., eBay Inc.\nv. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 393–94, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006) (rejecting this court's attempt\nto develop a rule regarding the right to injunctive relief “unique to patent disputes,” holding that “the traditional four-\nfactor framework ... governs the award of injunctive relief”). And, finally, it is Rule 19—not substantive judge-made\nlaws governing joinder-that establishes the criteria for assessing joinder. See Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v.\nPatterson, 390 U.S. 102, 118 n. 13, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968) (citing with approval to a commentator who\nnoted that “there is no case support for the proposition that the judge—made doctrines of compulsory joinder have\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n6\n\n\x0cSTC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 767 F.3d 1351 (2014)\n112 U.S.P.Q.2d 1294\n\ncreated substantive rights beyond the reach of the rulemaking power”) (quoting 2 Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice\n& Procedure § 512, n. 21.14 (1967 Supp.) (Wright ed.)).\n\nDespite these principles, the panel majority concludes that there is a substantive patent law right which not only makes\na patent co-owner a necessary party to an infringement action, but prohibits involuntary joinder of that necessary party\nand “trumps” the dictates of Rule 19. Careful scrutiny of the cases upon which the majority relies to create this overriding\nsubstantive patent law right reveals, however, that it is predicated upon a series of misinterpretations and misstatements\nof that purported authority. There is nothing, moreover, in either the panel majority opinion or the cases upon which\nit relies  *1359  which explains why any such substantive patent law right would be powerful enough to overcome the\nmandatory requirements of Rule 19(a).\n\nI believe we should consider this case en banc to analyze whether there is any statutory or other foundation for the so-\ncalled substantive patent law right to which the panel majority clings and, if so, whether it is that right, or Rule 19, that\nprovides the criteria for our analysis of joinder in this and other patent cases that come before us and the district courts.\nI respectfully dissent from the court's refusal to do so.\n\nI. RULE 19 IS MANDATORY\n\nAbsent  any  statutory  support  and  without  federal  common  law  authority,  there  is  no  source  from  which  the  panel\nmajority's alleged substantive right derives. Accordingly, we are required to apply Rule 19, and the panel majority's\nrefusal to do so violates the Rules Enabling Act.\n\nThe Rules Enabling Act provides that “[t]he Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules of practice\nand procedure and rules of evidence for cases in the United States district courts ... and courts of appeals.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2072(a). Those rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.” Id. at § 2072(b). Pursuant to this\nstatutorily-granted authority, the Supreme Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which: (1) “have\nthe force [and effect] of a federal statute,” Bright v. United States, 603 F.3d 1273, 1279 (Fed.Cir.2010) (“In light of this\nstatutory promulgation scheme, the Supreme Court has held that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are deemed to\nhave ‘the force [and effect] of a federal statute.’ ”) (citation omitted); and (2) apply in all civil actions, see Fed.R.Civ.P.\n1 (with certain limited exceptions, the Federal Rules “govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the\nUnited States district courts”).\n\nRule 19(a) provides for the involuntary joinder of a necessary party. The rule states, in relevant part, that:\n\n(a) Persons Required to be Joined if Feasible.\n\n(1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:\n\n(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or\n\n(B)that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action\nin the person's absence may:\n\n(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or\n\n(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent\nobligations because of the interest.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n7\n\n\x0cSTC.UNM v. Intel Corp., 767 F.3d 1351 (2014)\n112 U.S.P.Q.2d 1294\n\n(2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be\nmade a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an\ninvoluntary plaintiff.\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(1)-(2). By its terms, therefore, when a person satisfies the requirements of Rule 19(a), joinder of that\nperson is required.\n\nIf joinder of a required party is not feasible, Rule 19(b) provides that “the court must determine whether, in equity and\ngood conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b).\nThat analysis involves consideration of several  *1360  factors specified in Rule 19(b), including: (1) “the extent to which\na  judgment  rendered  in  the  person's  absence  might  prejudice  that  person  or  the  existing  parties”;  (2)  “the  extent  to\nwhich any prejudice could be lessened or avoided”; (3) “whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be\nadequate”; and (4) “whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.”\nFed.R.Civ.P. 19(b)(1)-(4).\n\nWe  have  determined  that  “[w]hether  a  party  is  indispensable  under  Rule  19(b)  is  a  matter  of  regional  circuit  law.”\nDainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. v. CFMT, Inc., 142 F.3d 1266, 1269 (Fed.Cir.1998). The Tenth Circuit applies a three\npart test to determine whether a party is “indispensable” to an adjudication. N. Arapaho Tribe v. Harnsberger, 697 F.3d\n1272, 1278 (10th Cir.2012). First, the court must find that the party is “required to be joined” under Rule 19(a). Id.\nSecond, “the court must determine that the required party cannot feasibly be joined.” Id. Finally, the court must assess\nunder Rule 19(b) “whether the required-but-not-feasibly-joined party is so important to the action” that it cannot “in\nequity and good conscience” proceed in the person's absence. Id. at 1278–79.\n\nHere, the district court essentially collapsed the three prongs of its Rule 19 analysis into one. The court found that:\n(1)  Sandia  is  a  necessary  party  because  “substantive  patent  law  requires  that  co-owners  of  a  patent  be  joined  in  an\ninfringement action”; (2) joinder of Sandia is not feasible “due to substantive patent law, which allows a co-owner to\ndecline to participate in an infringement action”; and (3) Sandia is indispensable because to find otherwise “would be to\nnegate one of the rights of patent ownership: to block an infringement action by refusing to participate.” Memorandum\n""]"

FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc) establishing the standard of appellate\nreview  of  district  court  decisions  concerning  the  meaning  and  scope  of  patent  claims—called  “claim  construction.”\nImplementing the Supreme Court's decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134\nL.Ed.2d 577 (1996) (Markman II ), aff'g Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc)\n(Markman I ), this court in Cybor held that patent claim construction receives de novo determination on appeal, that\nis, review for correctness as a matter of law. Such review is conducted on the administrative record and any additional\ninformation in the record of the district court, and is determined without deference to the ruling of the district court.\n\nIn  the  case  now  before  us,  a  panel  of  this  court  followed  the  Cybor  standard  and  revised  the  district  court's  claim\nconstruction, applying de novo the statutory requirements of 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 and § 112 ¶ 2. 1  Briefly, the panel\nheld that the claim term “voltage source means” is a means-plus-function term requiring corresponding structure in\nthe  specification.  On  this  claim  construction,  the  panel  reversed  the  district  court  and  held  the  claims  invalid  for\nindefiniteness. The patentee requests rehearing, stating that on deferential appellate review the district court would not\nor should not have been reversed. This court undertook rehearing en banc for the purpose of reconsidering the standard\nof appellate review of claim construction.\n\nFor the reasons we shall discuss, we apply the principles of stare decisis, and confirm the Cybor standard of de novo  *1277\nreview of claim construction, whereby the scope of the patent grant is reviewed as a matter of law. After fifteen years of\nexperience with Cybor, we conclude that the court should retain plenary review of claim construction, thereby providing\nnational uniformity, consistency, and finality to the meaning and scope of patent claims. The totality of experience has\nconfirmed that Cybor is an effective implementation of Markman II, and that the criteria for departure from stare decisis\nare not met.\n\nI\n\nTHE REHEARING ARGUMENTS\n\nLighting Ballast argues that de novo plenary determination of claim construction is improper appellate practice, stating\nthat the interpretation of documents is fundamentally factual in nature, and that the district court's interpretation of\npatent claims requires deference on appeal. Lighting Ballast states that on deferential review the district court's claim\nconstruction for the patent in suit would be sustained, along with the ensuing judgment that the claims in suit are valid\nand infringed.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nThis en banc court agreed to reconsider the principle of de novo review of claim construction, and invited supplemental\nbriefing and amicus curiae participation on the following questions:\n\n(1) Should this court overrule Cybor?\n\n(2) Should this court afford deference to any aspect of a district court's claim construction?\n\n(3) If so, which aspects should be afforded deference?\n\nThe parties as well as the amici curiae were not of one mind, but divided among three general views, all thoughtful and\nwell presented. 2  The general positions are summarized:\n\nThe first view\nThe view favored by Lighting Ballast is that the Cybor decision is incorrect and should be entirely discarded. Lighting\nBallast argues that this court in Cybor misapplied the Supreme Court's decision in Markman II, in that the Court had\nfocused only on whether questions of patent claim construction are subject to jury trial, or whether this issue should be\ndecided solely by a judge. These proponents state that the Court in Markman II, in deciding the judge-jury question,\ndid  not  change  the  traditional  distinction  between  fact  and  law,  recognized  that  there  are  factual  aspects  of  claim\nconstruction, and  *1278  did not address the standard of appellate review.\n\nThese proponents argue that the Court left intact the protocol of appellate deference to a district court's fact-based\nrulings, whether the facts relate to claim construction or any other issue, and whether the ruling is by a judge or by a jury.\nThey state that the Cybor standard of plenary appellate review is incorrect, and remind us that the Court in Markman\nII described claim construction as a “mongrel practice” of law and fact with “evidentiary underpinnings,” 517 U.S. at\n378, 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384. They argue that although the Court stated that “the interpretation of a so-called patent claim ...\nis a matter of law reserved entirely for the court,” id. at 372, 116 S.Ct. 1384, the Court did not strip claim construction\nof its essentially factual nature.\n\nThese  proponents  point  out  that  in  construing  patent  claims,  expert  testimony  and  documentary  evidence  may  be\npresented to the district court. They argue that restoration of deferential appellate review on the clear error standard\nwould  not  only  respect  the  traditional  trial/appellate  relationship,  but  also  is  more  likely  to  give  weight  to  aspects\ninvolving credibility of witnesses. They point out that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) requires that the district\ncourt's factual findings receive review on the deferential clearly erroneous standard, 3  citing Pullman–Standard v. Swint,\n456 U.S. 273, 287, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982) for its statement that Rule 52(a) “does not divide findings of\nfact into those that deal with ‘ultimate’ and those that deal with ‘subsidiary’ facts.”\n\nThese proponents argue that patent claim construction is most reasonably classified as a question of fact, and that the\nCourt's Markman II description of claim construction as better suited to determination by a judge rather than a jury\ndoes not affect the requirement of appellate deference to findings of fact made at the trial level. Thus Lighting Ballast\nurges that the Cybor standard of de novo review is incorrect and should be entirely discarded.\n\nThe second view\nThe second approach, favored by some amici curiae including the United States, may be viewed as a fusion or hybrid of\nde novo review and deferential review. These proponents acknowledge that the Court in Markman II described patents as\n“legal instruments” and stated that interpretation of patent claims is a “purely legal” matter, 517 U.S. at 391, 116 S.Ct.\n1384, but argue that the correct appellate approach is for the factual aspects of claim construction to be reviewed on\nthe clearly erroneous standard, while the final conclusion receives review as a matter of law. See, e.g., Brief of Amicus\nCuriae United States at 4 (“Because Cybor fails to acknowledge that claim construction may involve factual findings\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n7\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nentitled to deferential review under Rule 52(a), it should be overruled. But this Court should reaffirm that the ultimate\nconstruction of a patent claim is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review.”). The United States draws analogy to the\nruling in the regulatory tariff case of Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., 259 U.S. 285, 292, 42 S.Ct.\n477, 66 L.Ed. 943 (1922), that when ambiguity arises in the construction of certain legal instruments, the ambiguity is\nresolved as a question of fact.\n\nSome of these amici recognize that difficulties may arise in practice, in knowing  *1279  which aspects of the district\ncourt's claim construction are subject to deferential review and which aspects receive de novo determination. They suggest\na solution whereby the standard of review would depend on whether the district court's claim construction drew solely\nfrom the record of the patent and its prosecution history (called “intrinsic evidence”), or whether external information or\nwitness testimony was presented in the district court (that is, “extrinsic evidence”). Applying this distinction, some amici\npropose that claim constructions based on extrinsic evidence would receive clearly erroneous review, for such evidence\nmay entail credibility or reliability findings, while constructions based solely on the patent document and prosecution\nhistory would receive de novo review.\n\nThe proponents of a hybrid form of appellate review argue that this approach comports with the Court's position in\nMarkman II, yet respects the traditional roles of trial and appellate courts. Thus it is proposed that the standard of\nreview of claim construction should vary with the source and purpose of the evidence, drawing analogy to review of\nthe determination of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103. See Brief of Amicus Curiae American Bar Association at 12\n(“it is well settled that Rule 52(a) governs appellate review of the factual inquiries underlying the ultimate legal issue\nof obviousness”).\n\nThe third view\nThe third view, supported by some amici curiae, is that Cybor is both reasonable and correct in view of the Court's rulings\nin Markman II. These proponents stress the Court's statements that claim construction is a “purely legal” matter, 517\nU.S. at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384, and that “the interpretation of a so-called patent claim ... is a matter of law,” id. at 372,\n116 S.Ct. 1384. They argue that de novo review of the scope and meaning of patent claims conforms to the rule that\napplies in all areas of law, that “interpreting a set of legal words ... in order to determine their basic intent” is a “purely\nlegal matter.” Buford v. United States, 532 U.S. 59, 65, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). They state that sufficient\nreason has not been shown to change this established and effective precedent in patent cases.\n\nIn Markman II the Court placed claim construction in historical context, quoting Professor Robinson's treatise:\n\nThe  duty  of  interpreting  letters-patent  has  been  committed  to  the  courts.  A  patent  is  a  legal\ninstrument, to be construed, like other legal instruments, according to its tenor.... Where technical\nterms are used, or where the qualities of substances or operations mentioned or any similar data\nnecessary  to  the  comprehension  of  the  language  of  the  patent  are  unknown  to  the  judge,  the\ntestimony of witnesses may be received upon these subjects, and any other means of information be\nemployed. But in the actual interpretation of the patent the court proceeds upon its own responsibility,\nas an arbiter of the law, giving to the patent its true and final character and force.\n\n517 U.S. at 388, 116 S.Ct. 1384 (quoting 2 W. Robinson, Law of Patents § 732, pp. 481–83 (1890)) (emphasis the Court's).\nProponents of retaining the Cybor standard point to the Court's emphasis that the judge is responsible for “the actual\ninterpretation of the patent.” Id. These proponents also point to the Court's citation to Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104,\n106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985) in support of the Court's ruling in Markman II that:\n\n[W]hen an issue “falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact, the fact/law distinction\nat times has turned on a determination  *1280  that, as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nactor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.” So it turns out here, for judges, not juries, are\nthe better suited to find the acquired meaning of patent terms.\n\nMarkman II, 517 U.S. at 388, 116 S.Ct. 1384 (quoting Miller, 474 U.S. at 114, 106 S.Ct. 445). These proponents argue\nthat Miller confirms that the Court in Markman II intended to decide—and effectively did decide—both the judge/jury\nquestion and the fact/law question, as well as the related question concerning appellate review.\n\nThe Court's reliance on Miller in Markman II illustrates the Court's recourse to general jurisprudence and practical\nconsiderations,  suitably  applied,  in  resolving  patent  issues.  Proponents  of  adherence  to  Cybor  point  out  that  Miller\nreiterated the Court's recognition in Pullman–Standard that no principle will “ ‘unerringly distinguish a factual finding\nfrom a legal conclusion.’ ” Miller, 474 U.S. at 113, 106 S.Ct. 445 (quoting Pullman–Standard, 456 U.S. at 288, 102 S.Ct.\n1781). Proponents apply that observation to criticize departure from Cybor that would add, to the already complex laws\nof claim construction, a new and uncertain and contentious inquiry into which aspects of a particular construction fall\non which side of the fact-law line. These proponents state that Cybor is not subject to these difficulties, and that there is\nnot sufficient reason to impose this new area of dispute and peripheral litigation upon the trial and appeal of patent cases.\n\nThe proponents of stare decisis point to the courts' and patent community's fifteen years of experience with Cybor, and\nargue that this experience supports retention of the Cybor principle. Emphasizing the potential multi-case and multi-\nforum litigation of patents on today's technologies, they argue that it is particularly important that this court be able to\nresolve claim construction definitively as a matter of precedent, rather than allow differing trial court constructions of\nthe same patent, as may result from deferential review of close questions. As the Court observed in Markman II, “treating\ninterpretive issues as purely legal will promote (though it will not guarantee) intrajurisdictional certainty through the\napplication of stare decisis on those questions not yet subject to interjurisdictional uniformity under the authority of the\nsingle appeals court.” 517 U.S. at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384.\n\nThus it is argued that the meaning and scope of a patent claim, which sets the boundaries of an exclusionary right good\nagainst the world at large, rather than only for parties to a voluntary transaction or only for the plaintiff and defendant\nin a particular case, should be construed based on publicly available materials in the record, and resolved for uniform\napplication throughout the nation, as a matter of law. No party or amicus disputed that the only way to achieve uniform\nconstruction of the same claim, a goal recognized in Markman II, is by de novo appellate construction of the claim as\na matter of law. There is no dispute as to the importance of national uniformity and finality of claim construction, for\nit is not unusual for different district courts to litigate the same patent against different parties and different assertions\nof infringement.\n\nIn sum, these proponents argue that the Cybor standard of review of claim construction reasonably and appropriately\nimplements the Court's ruling in Markman II, and urge this court to stand by Cybor and its fifteen years of experience.\nProponents of stability through the principles of stare decisis stress that consistency of legal analysis and reliability of\njudicial process are foundations of not only legal  *1281  systems generally, but also of the technological advance and\nindustrial commitment that are goals of the patent system. See Brief of Amici Curiae Cisco et al. at 15 (“Competing and\ninconsistent interpretations of patent claims obscure the boundaries of patents and deeply undermine their important\nnotice function, inevitably resulting in more—rather than less—litigation.”); id. at 19 (“Clear scope is important to all\npotential market entrants. This kind of horizontal certainty is important to the entire industry.”).\n\nThe  criticism  of  Cybor  is  not  based  on  any  demonstration  that  de  novo  claim  construction  is  likely  to  be  incorrect,\nbut rather on concerns for judicial roles and relationships. We do not ignore these important concerns. However, as\nproponents of stare decisis point out, Cybor is narrowly focused on the threshold construction of a legal document,\nand does not affect the traditional deference to district court findings of infringement or validity or damages or any\nother question of fact in patent litigation. The proponents remind us that Cybor was adopted in implementation of the\nMarkman decisions of this court and the Supreme Court, and is in accord with these rulings on the nature of the patent\ngrant and the judicial obligation for correct determination of the legal scope of the patent grant.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nThus it is urged that the Cybor standard should not now be abandoned for a more costly and litigious standard, with\ndiminished stability of procedure and diminished reliability of outcome, and no greater likelihood of correctness of result.\nThese proponents point out that those who would change Cybor's system of plenary review of claim construction have\nnot shown any benefit or advantage to the law or those served by the law. Thus it is argued that the values of stare decisis\ncounsel against overturning Cybor.\n\nII\n\nSTARE DECISIS\n\n[1]\n The question now before this en banc court is not the same question that was before the en banc court in 1998\nwhen Cybor was decided. The question now is not whether to adopt a de novo standard of review of claim construction,\nbut whether to change that standard adopted fifteen years ago and applied in many hundreds of decisions. There has\nbeen extensive experience of Cybor in action, in the district court and on appeal. “Claim construction” has become the\ngateway issue in patent litigation, often decided in preliminary proceedings before trial and before discovery, and often\nsubject to immediate appeal on summary judgment or injunction grounds. Such experience enriches the principle that\ncourts will “stand by things decided” so that prior rulings may be relied upon.\n\n  [3]\n\n Stare decisis is of “fundamental importance to the rule of law.” Hilton v. S. Carolina Pub. Ry. Comm'n, 502 U.S.\n\n[2]\n197, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991) (quoting Welch v. Texas Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 483 U.S. 468,\n494, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987)). The doctrine of stare decisis enhances predictability and efficiency in dispute\nresolution and legal proceedings, by enabling and fostering reliance on prior rulings. CSX Transp. Inc. v. McBride, –––\nU.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 2630, 2641, 180 L.Ed.2d 637 (2011). By providing stability of law that has been decided, stare decisis\nis the foundation of a nation governed by law. The Supreme Court has said: “we will not depart from the doctrine of\nstare decisis without some compelling justification.” Hilton, 502 U.S. at 202, 112 S.Ct. 560 (citing Arizona v. Rumsey,\n467 U.S. 203, 212, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 81 L.Ed.2d 164 (1984)); see   *1282  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443, 120\nS.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (“special justification” is needed to overrule precedent).\n\n  [5]\n\n Stability in procedural as well as substantive law, on which the public and the courts can rely, guards against\n\n[4]\nthe expenditure of time and resources on aspects that have been resolved. These values come to the fore when a court\nundertakes to reexamine its own precedent, for stare decisis implements the “prudential and pragmatic considerations\ndesigned to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective\ncosts of reaffirming and overruling a prior case.” Planned Parenthood of S.E. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 854, 112 S.Ct.\n2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). The principles and policies of stare decisis operate with full force where, as here, the en\nbanc court is considering overturning its own en banc precedent.\n\n[6]\n The presumption that a court will adhere to its prior rulings has “ ‘special force’ ” for precedents that resolve non-\nconstitutional issues, for “ ‘Congress remains free to alter what we have done.’ ” J.R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,\n552 U.S. 130, 139, 128 S.Ct. 750, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008) (quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164,\n172–73, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989)). In Patterson the Court observed that the same issue had previously\ndivided the Court and that “[s]ome Members of this Court believe that [the precedent] was decided incorrectly”; the\nCourt discussed the principles of stare decisis, and concluded that “no special justification has been shown for overruling”\nthe prior decision, for neither “the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.... have removed\nor weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision.” 491 U.S. at 171–173, 109 S.Ct. 2363. The Court\nobserved that no “later law has rendered the decision irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines or policies.” Id. at\n173, 109 S.Ct. 2363.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

United States, 524 U.S. 236, 253, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) the Court discussed its precedent\nin light of stare decisis, and stated that “[o]nce we have decided to reconsider a particular rule, however, we would be\nremiss if we did not consider the consistency with which it has been applied in practice.” In Global–Tech Appliances, Inc.\nv. SEB S.A., ––– U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 2060, 2067–68, 179 L.Ed.2d 1167 (2011) the Court observed that although its prior\ndecision on the same issue was “badly fractured,” the majority holding “has become a fixture in the law,” warranting\napplication of the doctrine of stare decisis.\n\n[7]\n The purposes of consistency and stability that underlie stare decisis led to the formation of the Federal Circuit, now\nthirty years past, to provide consistency and stability to the patent law: “The central purpose is to reduce the widespread\nlack of uniformity and uncertainty of legal doctrine that exist in the administration of patent law,” H.R. REP. 97–312,\nat 23 (1981), in view of the importance of technology-based advance to the nation's economy, id.; S. REP. 97–275, at\n6 (1981) (same). Legal doctrine in patent law starts with the construction of patent claims, for the claims measure the\nlegal rights provided by the patent.\n\n[8]\n In the Federal Circuit decision that led to the Supreme Court's Markman II ruling, this court explained that reviewing\nclaim construction as a matter of law assures “a true and consistent scope of the claims.” Markman I, 52 F.3d at 979.\nThe Court did not adjust or criticize that position, which forms the foundation of Cybor. Cybor, in carrying forward\nMarkman I in  *1283  light of Markman II, embodies the view that de novo review will “help institute a simplified and\nclarified method by which both trial and appellate courts address claim construction issues.” Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1463\n(Plager, J., concurring).\n\n  [10]\n\n We do not ignore that neither Cybor nor the Markman decisions were free of contention, then as now. As we\n\n[9]\nundertake this review of Cybor, we recognize that stare decisis is not an “inexorable command,” Agostini v. Felton, 521\nU.S. 203, 235, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). Thus we have considered whether there are sound reasons for\nthis court now to depart from this precedent. We proceed with the guidance of history, experience, and the many amici\ncuriae, while retaining awareness that to overturn an en banc ruling that has had long and wide application, there must\nbe more than controversy about the prior rule. See Watson v. United States, 552 U.S. 74, 82, 128 S.Ct. 579, 169 L.Ed.2d\n472 (2007) (“A difference of opinion within the Court ... does not keep the door open for another try....”). As observed\nin Morrow v. Balaski, 719 F.3d 160, 181 (3d Cir.2013) (Smith, J., concurring), “the very point of stare decisis is to forbid\nus from revisiting a debate every time there are reasonable arguments to be made on both sides.”\n\n[11]\n However, departure from precedent may be appropriate when “subsequent cases have undermined [its] doctrinal\nunderpinnings,” Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326; or when the precedent has proved “unworkable,” J.R. Sand\n& Gravel Co., 552 U.S. at 139, 128 S.Ct. 750; or when “a considerable body of new experience” requires changing the\nlaw, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 234, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009).\n\n  [13]\n\n Stare decisis embraces procedural as well as substantive precedent. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 266,\n\n[12]\n106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986) (considering whether procedures have so far developed as to have left the old rule\n“outdated, ill-founded, unworkable, or otherwise legitimately vulnerable to serious reconsideration”); Swift & Co. v.\nWickham, 382 U.S. 111, 116, 86 S.Ct. 258, 15 L.Ed.2d 194 (1965) (overruling procedural precedent where “unworkable in\npractice,” among other problems). Procedures in the litigation-prone arena of patent rights can affect the cost, time, and\nuncertainty of litigation, and in turn affect economic activity founded on the presence or absence of enforceable patents.\nCourts should be “cautious before adopting changes that disrupt the settled expectations of the inventing community.”\nFesto Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722, 739, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002).\n\n[14]\n Applying these premises, we have reviewed the arguments for changing the Cybor procedure of de novo review\nof  claim  construction.  First,  we  have  looked  for  post  Cybor  developments,  whether  from  the  Supreme  Court,  from\nCongress, or from this court, that may have undermined the reasoning of Cybor. None has been found, or brought to our\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n11\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nattention. There has been no legislative adjustment of the Cybor procedure, despite extensive patent-related legislative\nactivity during the entire period of Cybor's existence.\n\nWe have looked for some demonstration that Cybor has proved unworkable. No proponent of change has shown that de\nnovo review of claim construction is unworkable—nor could they, after fifteen years of experience of ready workability.\nNor has anyone shown that Cybor has increased the burdens on the courts or litigants conducting claim construction.\n\nTo the contrary, reversing Cybor or modifying it to introduce a fact/law distinction has a high potential to diminish\nworkability  *1284  and increase burdens by adding a new and uncertain inquiry, not only on appeal but also in the trial\ntribunal. No consensus has emerged as to how to adjust Cybor to resolve its perceived flaws. Despite probing questioning\nat the en banc hearing, and despite the extensive amicus curiae participation, there is no agreement on a preferable new\nmechanism of appellate review of claim construction; there is no analysis of how deference would be applied to the\ndiversity of old and new technologies and modes of claiming, no clear exposition of fact or law as could be applicable to\nthe millions of unexpired patents, each on a different new technologic advance. As will be discussed, no one, including\nthe dissent, proposes a workable replacement standard for Cybor, no workable delineation of what constitutes fact and\nwhat constitutes law.\n\nDisentangling arguably factual aspects, some in dispute and some not, some the subject of expert or other testimony\nand some not, some elaborated by documentary evidence and some not, some construed by the district court and some\nnot, some related to issues to be decided by a jury and some not—and further disentangling factual aspects from the\napplication of law to fact—is a task ripe for lengthy peripheral litigation. We are not persuaded that we ought to overturn\nthe  en  banc  Cybor  decision  and  replace  its  clear  de  novo  standard  with  an  amorphous  standard  that  places  a  new,\ncumbersome, and costly process at the gate, to engender threshold litigation over whether there was or was not a fact at\nissue. The principles of stare decisis counsel against such an unnecessary change.\n\nNo critic of Cybor has provided any analysis of specific claims or cases to show, or even to suggest, that deferential\nappellate review is more likely to achieve the correct claim construction. The principles of stare decisis counsel against\noverturning precedent when there is no evidence of unworkability and no clearly better resolution. The amici curiae\nagreed that modification of Cybor is unlikely to change many results, even if it could be defined well (which it has not\nbeen, by any amicus or by our colleagues in dissent).\n\n  [16]\n\n  [17]\n\n Claim construction is a legal statement of the scope of the patent right; it does not turn on witness\n\n[15]\ncredibility, but on the content of the patent documents. The court may indeed benefit from explanation of the technology\nand the instruction of treatises, but the elaboration of experts or tutorial explanation of technical subject matter does not\nconvert patent claim construction into a question of fact. The type of evidence that may assist a lay judge in determining\nwhat a technical term meant to one of skill in the art does not transform that meaning from a question of law into a\nquestion of fact. Reference to technical understanding and usage at the time of enactment does not convert statutory\ninterpretation from law to fact. See, e.g., Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 202, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d\n1 (1974) (applying “the language of industrial relations” to statutory interpretation).\n\nCourts routinely look to dictionaries and treatises to determine the meaning of a statute at the time it was written.\nSee, e.g., Sandifer v. U.S. Steel Corp., ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S.Ct. 870, 187 L.Ed.2d 729 (2014) (looking to dictionaries\nto determine the meaning of “changing clothes” in the Fair Labor Standards Act at the time of enactment); Comm'r\nv. Soliman, 506 U.S. 168, 113 S.Ct. 701, 121 L.Ed.2d 634 (1993) (interpreting the tax code by looking to dictionary\ndefinitions at the time of enactment); Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991)\n(using dictionaries to ascertain the  *1285  ordinary meaning of “mixture” in the drug statute).\n\nSimilarly, experts in the science or technology may assist the court in understanding the meaning and usage of a claim\nterm, but this does not morph the question into one of fact.

The Court stated in Markman II:\n\nin  theory  there  could  be  a  case  in  which  a  simple  credibility  judgment  would  suffice  to  choose\nbetween  experts  whose  testimony  was  equally  consistent  with  a  patent's  internal  logic.  But  our\nown experience with document construction leaves us doubtful that trial courts will run into many\ncases like that. In the main, we expect, any credibility determinations will be subsumed within the\nnecessarily sophisticated analysis of the whole document, required by the standard construction\nrule that a term can be defined only in a way that comports with the instrument as a whole.\n\n517 U.S. at 389, 116 S.Ct. 1384. This expectation has proven accurate. The presentation of expert testimony on the\nmeaning of a claim term does not transform the question from one of law to one of fact.\n\nWe have carefully considered the arguments for discarding or modifying Cybor, and conclude that they do not justify\ndeparting  from  the  now  well-established  principles  and  procedures.  Under  any  standard  of  review  consistent  with\nMarkman II, most issues of claim construction are indisputably matters of law, and would receive de novo review. Even\nthe critics of Cybor agree that any change would affect only a small number of claim construction disputes. Statements\nat  the  en  banc  hearing  are  edifying;  e.g.,  Tr.  at  1:14:10–1:14:35  (Appellant)  (“This  court  could,  in  whatever  it  does\nwith Cybor, make very clear that this battle of competing experts is rarely productive, rarely going to influence claim\nconstruction.... If you said to me, why doesn't stare decisis carry the day? I don't have a good answer to that.”); id. at\n55:15–55:20 (United States) (“this court's law on claim construction requires very little modification”); id. at 1:06:50–\n1:07:30 (United States) (whether a term has special meaning in the art could be “meaningless ultimately” if inconsistent\nwith the intrinsic record).\n\nIn response to a question at the hearing, amicus curiae United States could not identify any case that would have come\nout differently under the modified (hybrid) standard of review it proposed. Tr. at 1:07:30–1:08:00. Certainly stare decisis\ncounsels against overturning en banc precedent where doing so would change our known, workable de novo standard\nto an undefined alternative, sure to engender peripheral litigation, and which most agree could affect the outcome of\nvery few, if any cases. See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236–37, 129 S.Ct. 808 (criticizing precedent that “sometimes results in a\nsubstantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case”).\n\nClaim construction is often a preliminary proceeding in the district court, before trial of infringement, validity, damages,\netc. At the threshold, the court establishes the metes and bounds of the claims that define the patent right. The questions\nof claim construction are not questions of weight of evidence or credibility of witnesses, but of the claim scope as set\nforth in the patent documents.\n\n[18]\n Claim construction is the interpretation of a legal document that establishes  *1286  a property right that applies\nthroughout the nation. The question under review is whether this court, of nation-wide jurisdiction, should continue to\nreview claim construction de novo with national effect, or whether to change to a system whereby a district court's claim\nconstruction is reviewed on the deferential standard appropriate to findings of fact, with or without some sort of hybrid\ndeference to the ultimate determination. The insistence of some amici curiae that some form of deferential review is\nrequired as well as superior, is not only contrary to the Markman holdings, but to the experience of fifteen years of Cybor.\n\nIn the increasingly frequent situation where the same patent is litigated in different forums against different defendants,\ndiffering district court rulings on close questions of claim construction could well warrant affirmance on deferential\nreview. Because differing claim constructions can lead to different results for infringement and validity, the possibility of\ndisparate district court constructions unravels the “uniformity in the treatment of a given patent” that the Court sought\nto achieve in Markman II. 517 U.S. at 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384. It would restore the forum shopping that the Federal Circuit\nwas created to avoid. Just as the Court in Markman II counted such consequences as negatives that its ruling overcame,\nthey count as negatives in the stare decisis analysis.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nThe question that this court has now reconsidered is whether we should continue to review claim construction as a whole\nand de novo on the record, or whether we should change to a different system that at best would require us to identify\nany factual aspects and how the trial judge decided them, and review any found or inferred facts not for correctness but\non a deferential standard, with or without also giving deferential review to the ultimate determination of the meaning of\nthe claims. We conclude that such changed procedure is not superior to the existing posture of plenary review of claim\nconstruction.\n\nOver these fifteen years this court has applied Cybor to diverse subject matter, and the body of precedent has grown\nlarge. Deferential review does not promise either improved consistency or increased clarity. We have been offered no\nargument of public policy, or changed circumstances, or unworkability or intolerability, or any other justification for\nchanging the Cybor methodology and abandoning de novo review of claim construction.\n\nThe proponents of overruling Cybor have not met the demanding standards of the doctrine of stare decisis. They have not\nshown that Cybor is inconsistent with any law or precedent, or that greater deference will produce any greater public or\nprivate benefit. We conclude that there is neither “grave necessity” nor “special justification” for departing from Cybor.\n\nIII\n\nREMARKS ON THE DISSENT\n\nOur colleagues in dissent offer a few arguments that warrant response. First, referring to “the materials submitted to\nthe court,” the dissent states that “a substantial proportion of the legal community” believes that Cybor was “wrongly\ndecided.” Diss. at 1298. The materials tell a different tale.\n\nAs listed ante, at n. 2, thirty-eight organizations and individuals filed twenty-one amicus briefs. Contrary to the dissent's\nstatements, all of the technology industries that offered advice to the court, urge retention of Cybor's standard. These\namici curiae include the largest technology companies in the nation, all involved with the system of patents, all frequent\npatent  *1287  litigants both as plaintiffs and as defendants—unlike all of the other amici. 4  The dissent dismisses these\nvoices as merely “some amici” who support retention of Cybor, Diss. at 1298, and offers no response to their concerns\nfor stability, national uniformity, and predictability in claim construction.\n\nThe  dissent  appears  unconcerned  that  the  major  industrial  amici  urge  retention  of  the  Cybor  standard,  and  instead\nannounces that “no one in the legal community—except perhaps the members of the majority—has come to believe that\neither the wisdom or vitality of Cybor is settled,” Diss. at 1298. This conclusion is curious. For example, the amicus brief\nof Google, Amazon, Hewlett–Packard, Red Hat and Yahoo! states that departing from Cybor would “make worse” the\nuncertainty of claim construction:\n\n[T]he root causes of uncertainty in claim construction are vaguely drafted claims and contradictory claim-construction\nmethodologies, not appellate review. Deference would not ameliorate those causes of uncertainty; it would make them\nworse.\n\n* * *\n\n[T]reating claim construction as a factual question subject to clear-error review would only aggravate the uncertainty\nand cost issues plaguing our patent-litigation system.\n\nBrief of Amicus Curiae Google et al. at 4, 5.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n14\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nThe industrial amici also respond to the argument, pressed by the dissenters, that treating claim construction as a matter\nof law negates settlement and increases litigation cost. Diss. at 1313. These litigants advise that the contrary is true:\n\n[C]lassifying claim construction as being at least partly factual would make patent litigation even\nmore costly by discouraging courts from resolving claim construction disputes at the outset. Early\nclaim construction is essential to permit the parties to file summary judgment motions, or to engage\nin informed settlement discussions, before they have to incur potentially unnecessary discovery\nand other pre-trial costs—costs that force many defendants to settle even meritless cases solely\nbecause the exorbitant cost of litigating a case would exceed the settlement amount demanded by\nthe plaintiff.\n\nGoogle et al. Br. at 4–5. Even Appellant's counsel at oral argument contradicted the cost-of-litigation and settlement\narguments:\n\nA lot of commentators have said Cybor is preventing settlements: I don't believe that. I settle cases\nall the time. No one has ever focused primarily or even significantly on the standard of review on\nappeal. They're focused on the jury. They're focused on the cost of litigation. So a lot of what's been\nput up as reasons to change Cybor I don't think are there.\n\nTr. 1:14:40–1:15:05.\n\nIn the brief filed by Cisco, Dell, EMC, Intel, SAP, and the SAS Institute, these amici curiae suggest that the proponents\nof overturning Cybor incorrectly conflate concepts of uncertainty with appellate reversal rates. These amici explain that\nany possible uncertainty of affirmance on appeal is not the issue in claim construction;  *1288  rather, the issue is how\nto generate accuracy and uniformity in claim construction, that is, how to construe claims correctly and predictably.\n\nClear scope is important to all potential market entrants. This kind of horizontal certainty is important to the entire\nindustry. By contrast, the concern that de novo review increases the “duration” of a single patent litigation until a\nfinal decision is reached in that particular case (Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1476 (Rader, J., dissenting))—what might be called\nvertical uncertainty—matters only in the small fraction of cases that reach an appeal. Vertical uncertainty is more\nvisible than horizontal uncertainty, but, as often is the case, here it is the unseen effects that are greater. Cf. Frédéric\nBastiat, What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen (1848), available at http:// www. econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss1.html.\n\nFor this reason, it is not merely the overarching principles of claim construction, but their application, that must be\nconsistent. In claim construction as elsewhere, “the relevant legal principle can be given meaning only through its\napplication to the particular circumstances of a case.” Miller, 474 U.S. at 114, 106 S.Ct. 445.\n\nBrief of Amicus Curiae Cisco et al. at 19.\n\nThe Cisco amici emphasize the Supreme Court's recognition of “the importance of uniformity” in Markman II, 517 U.S.\nat 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384, and stress that treating claim construction issues as “purely legal,” id. at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384,\nenables appellate review to supply that uniformity:\n\nFederal Circuit review, and in particular this Court's application of stare decisis, is critical to such uniformity. As\nthe Supreme Court explained, “treating interpretive issues as purely legal” will allow stare decisis to be applied to\nthose interpretive questions and thus promote uniformity among decisions of this Court (so-called “intrajurisdictional\ncertainty”).\n\nCisco et al. Br. at 5 (citing and quoting Markman II, 517 U.S. at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384). These amici also discuss the\n“hybrid” proposal of some theorists, and state:\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\n“treating interpretive issues as purely legal”—not as a mixed question—is the proper approach.\n\nId. at 5 (quoting Markman II, 517 U.S. at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384).\n\nAmicus Microsoft discusses another aspect of the Cybor treatment of claim construction, advising that de novo review\n\nworks well in practice because it allows the parties to address questions concerning claim scope in\npre-trial hearings well in advance of the actual trial. Having a jury decide these redesignated factual\nmatters could eliminate the current practice of pre-trial Markman hearings. This would exacerbate\nthe expense and uncertainty in patent litigation and create new opportunities for forum shopping.\n\nBrief of Amicus Curiae Microsoft at 3.\n\nIn sum, the amici curiae record of the nation's major innovators is contrary to the dissent's representation that “no one\nin the legal community—except perhaps the members of the majority—has come to believe that either the wisdom or\nvitality of Cybor is settled.” Diss. at 1298. The amici curiae record is contrary to the dissent's pronouncement that “the\ninterests of stability and predictability are disserved” by Cybor's access to final, uniform, national claim construction.\nDiss. at 1310. The nation's major innovators do not agree with the criticisms of Cybor, and so advised the court. These\namici direct the court to the pragmatic value of Cybor as they have experienced it, and urge retention of that value.\n\n*1289  Rather than respond to the concerns of the nation's technology industries, the dissent chastizes certain judges of\nthis court for not “acting on their long-term convictions.” Diss. at 1296. While it is comforting to know that our golden\nwords of the past are not forgotten, those of us with the majority today who have questioned aspects of Cybor in the past,\nnow decide this case on the record of the present and with an eye to the future. The dissent would discard the experience\nof the past fifteen years. However, the court is not now deciding whether to adopt a de novo standard in 1998. Today we\ndecide whether to cast aside the standard that has been in place for fifteen years.\n\nThe dissent offers no superior alternative to de novo review, nor any workable standard for distinguishing between legal\nand factual components of claim construction. The dissent does not appear to adopt the proposal of several amici that\nappellate deference should depend on whether the district court relied on intrinsic or extrinsic evidence in construing a\nclaim term. It is surely doubtful that such a distinction controls whether claim construction is fact or law. See Phillips\nv. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1317 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc) (discussing sources of evidence in claim construction, and\nstating “while extrinsic evidence ‘can shed useful light on the relevant art,’ we have explained that it is ‘less significant\nthan the intrinsic record in determining the “legally operative meaning of claim language” ’ ”) (citing cases). We have\ncome upon no rationale for denominating an issue of claim construction as one of fact or law depending on the source\nof the information considered by the judge.\n\n[19]\n The dissent seems to embrace (then expand upon) the “historical fact” notion proposed by Appellant, who states\nthat the meaning a person of ordinary skill in the art would give a term at the time of the filing of the patent application\nought to be treated as a question of fact. This is not a question of fact; it is the very inquiry which determines the claim\nconstruction in nearly all cases. Claim terms are given their ordinary meaning to one of skill in the art, unless the patent\ndocuments show that the patentee departed from that meaning. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314; Thorner v. Sony Computer\nEntm't Am., LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2012). Treating the ordinary meaning to a skilled artisan as requiring\ndeference would mean deference on the controlling question of claim construction in nearly every case. All the more so\nwith the dissent's proposed treatment of still additional issues, such as prosecution disclaimer, as warranting deference.\nDiss. at 1316.\n\nUnder  the  dissent's  approach,  and  even  under  the  “historical  fact”  approach,  deference  would  become  of  central\nsignificance in controlling the determination of claim construction, and hence of patent scope. The consequence would be\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n16\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nheightened forum-shopping and the inability of the judicial system to arrive at a uniform, settled meaning for a patent's\nscope. Those problems are grave ones given the increasingly common situation of multiple cases involving the same\npatent.\n\nThe  dissenters  do  not  explain  why  they  choose  to  abandon  the  benefits  foreseen  by  the  Court  in  Markman  II,  that\n“treating interpretive issues as purely legal” would have benefits of “intrajurisdictional certainty.” 517 U.S. at 391, 116\nS.Ct. 1384. Nor have they successfully explained away the analysis in Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. at 113–14, 106 S.Ct.\n445, that:\n\n[T]he practical truth that the decision to label an issue a “question of law,” a “question of fact,” or a “mixed question\nof law and fact” is sometimes as much a matter of allocation as it is of analysis.... [T]he fact/law distinction at  *1290\ntimes has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better\npositioned than another to decide the issue in question.\n\n(cited in Markman II, 517 U.S. at 388, 116 S.Ct. 1384). The Court in Miller explained that the fact/law distinction is\nnot immutable, and may invoke “the sound administration of justice,” id. at 114, 106 S.Ct. 445, leading to a similar\nacknowledgement in the Markman II ruling that claim construction is “a matter of law reserved entirely for the court.”\n517 U.S. at 372, 116 S.Ct. 1384.\n\nIn addition, the dissent downplays the gravity of overturning a previous en banc court in the absence of intervening\nSupreme Court or legislative action. Of the several decisions of the Federal Circuit that the dissent cites as setting a pattern\nof overturning precedent, all involve en banc review of panel precedents, with the arguable exception of Nobelpharma\nAB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1068 & n. 5 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc in relevant part), where the court\nclarified that this court's law would govern the question of patent/antitrust immunity.\n\n[20]\n The major thrust of the dissent is that Federal Rule 52(a)(6) requires deferential review of district court decisions.\nBut Rule 52(a) does not answer the question here. Rule 52(a) prescribes the standard of review of questions of fact, but\ncourts must look outside the Rule to decide if a question is properly characterized as one of fact. As the Court stated\nin Pullman–Standard, 456 U.S. at 288, 102 S.Ct. 1781, “Rule 52(a) does not furnish particular guidance with respect to\ndistinguishing law from fact. Nor do we yet know of any other rule or principle that will unerringly distinguish a factual\nfinding from a legal conclusion.” The dissent's theory that Rule 52(a) demands abandonment of de novo review of claim\nconstruction is a simplistic disregard of the Markman II guidance that “treating interpretive issues as purely legal will\npromote (though it will not guarantee) intrajurisdictional certainty.” 517 U.S. at 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384.\n\nThe dissent argues that de novo review produces a high reversal rate, although it is established that this is no longer true.\nThe reversal rate indeed was a matter of concern, for in the early years of Cybor, this court's promulgation of claim\nconstruction law led to a higher rate of appellate adjustment. However, as consistency evolved and experience grew, rates\nof appellate reversal for claim construction came to match the norm for other grounds. We observe that every amicus\nbrief that complains about high reversal rates relies on data that are seven to ten or more years old, while the author of\na recent study writes in his amicus brief that the data “document a significant drop in the claim construction reversal\nrate” since 2005, Brief of Amicus Curiae Professor Peter Menell at 15, and explains in his study that “[n]ow the reversal\nrate for claim construction appeals is much closer to that of other patent-related issues.” J. Jonas Anderson & Peter S.\nMenell, Informal Deference: An Historical, Empirical, and Normative Analysis of Patent Claim Construction, 108 Nw.\nU.L.Rev. (forthcoming), Sept. 9, 2013 manuscript at 37.\n\nOur colleagues in dissent, citing the obsolete data, argue that the de novo standard “adds considerable uncertainty and\nexpense to patent litigation,” Diss. at 1297, stating that this standard increases appeals, discourages settlement, and\nincreases the length and cost of litigation. No evidence of this effect is offered, and all of the amici curiae who are frequent\nlitigants state the contrary position. The data published by the Administrative Office of the  *1291  United States Courts\npoint the other way. These data show a long, noticeable decline in the percentage of district court patent cases that are\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nappealed, belying the argument that appeals have increased. The following data are from the Annual Reports of the\nAdministrative Office for the years 1994 to 2013. The graph shows the ratio, as a percentage, of the number of patent\nappeals filed per year (Report Table B–8), against the number of district court patent cases filed in that year (Report\nTable C–2):\n\nThe Annual Reports also show the trend in the percentage of patent cases that proceed to trial in the district courts. The\ndata from Table C–4 in the Reports show the percentage declining from 5.9% in 1994 to 2.8% in 2013:\n\nThe data do not support the dissent's theory that Cybor has increased patent litigation and inhibited settlements. In\ncontrast, the industrial amici curiae advise the court that the Cybor review procedure assists in resolving litigation before\nfull trial or extensive discovery, for it often leads to the grant of summary judgment and an immediate appeal. These\namici stress that settlement is facilitated by final resolution  *1292  of the scope of the claims. They also point out that\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

The dissent does\nnot comment on these values.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have again considered the standard of review of district court claim construction rulings, in light of experience with\nthe Cybor standard. The ever-enlarging importance of technology-based industry in the economy has reinforced the need\nfor an optimum patent system.\n\nOn thorough review, we are not persuaded that discarding de novo review would produce a better or more reliable or more\naccurate or more just determination of patent claim scope. Those who urge change in the Cybor standard have identified\nno pattern of error, no indictment of inferior results. No ground has been shown for departing from the principles of\nstare decisis. Review of claim construction as a matter of law has demonstrated its feasibility, experience has enlarged\nits values, and no clearly better alternative has been proposed. There has arisen no intervening precedent, no contrary\nlegislation, no shift in public policy, no unworkability of the standard.\n\nWe conclude that the criteria are not met for overruling or modifying the Cybor standard of de novo review of claim\nconstruction as a matter of law.\n\nNo costs.\n\nPANEL DECISION REINSTATED\n\nLOURIE, Circuit Judge, concurring.\nI fully agree with the majority opinion and join it. I write separately to note what I believe are additional reasons why\nretaining Cybor is wise.\n\nFirst and foremost is that the Supreme Court has held that claim construction is a question for the court rather than\nthe jury. Thus, for us to appear to be cutting back from that holding by giving formal deference on so-called fact-like\nquestions, which normally would go to the jury, to the district court judge, would seem to me to be an attempt to partially\nretreat from the Court's holding, which is unwise.\n\nWe have held that claim construction is a question of law, going only minimally beyond the Court's explicit holding that\nit is only a question for the court. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1454–55 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc).\nThe Court's holding, including its statement that it is a “mongrel” question, does not encourage fractionation of the\nprocess, making part of it subject to de novo review and part clearly erroneous review. The Court in Markman stated\nthat construction of terms of art should be ceded to the judge “notwithstanding its evidentiary underpinnings.” The\n“notwithstanding” applies to any factual as well as legal aspects of claim construction. Evidentiary underpinnings do\nnot lean toward a clearly erroneous standard any more than they do to the jury.\n\nEqually important, one of the purposes of Congress in creating our court was to achieve uniformity in the patent law.\nConsistent with that goal should be uniformity of interpretation in construction of patent claims. It is not rare that a\npatent is asserted against more than one defendant in different forums, with conflicting holdings on infringement. It\nwould hardly promote uniformity of patent law for us to bless a claim construction in one district court, based on that\ncourt's judging the credibility and demeanor of the expert witnesses in one case, when a different case might lead to a\ndifferent result based on a different district judge's appraisal of different  *1293  witnesses. We in fact might be confirming\nconflicting claim constructions, the antithesis of uniformity. This problem might increasingly exist in light of the AIA's\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n19\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nlimits on the number of accused infringers that can be joined as defendants in one lawsuit, thereby creating the possibility\nof more lawsuits on the same patent, and more inconsistency, than existed in the past. See 35 U.S.C. § 299(a); In re EMC\nCorp., 677 F.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir.2012).\n\nBy our deferring to those determinations, conceding our full review of the meaning of a claim term, which should be\nbased on the patent's written description and prosecution history, not the witnesses, hampers our ability to interpret\nclaims with full authority and hence to ensure uniformity.\n\nFurthermore, claim construction is not a process that normally involves historical facts. It primarily involves reading\nthe patent's written description as well as the prosecution history of the patent, and this court is quite as able to do that\nas any district court, sometimes better. It is true that there may be questions concerning what a particular claim term\nmeant to one skilled in the art at a particular time, but, in my view, when the trial judge is subjected to dueling experts\nselected for their views, choosing which of them to credit hardly amounts to historical fact-finding. To the extent that\nit does, the relevant inquiry should be, not what the dueling experts say, but what the inventor understood the term to\nmean when he or she filed the patent application containing the claim term in question. Courts should be reluctant to go\nbeyond the written record to help answer that question. It is too subject to ex post facto thinking based on self-interest;\nthe inventor had his chance to define his invention and should not be heard in later testimony to get another bite at the\napple by redefining that language.\n\nA realistic assessment of the problem in claim construction in litigation recognizes that the patenting process begins with\nan inventor and his or her attorney drafting a written description and claims to describe and specifically claim his or her\ninvention. The claims will usually then get negotiated in the Patent Office. The issued claims are then used, pursuant to\nsome perceived business need or desire, by a different lawyer who had no part in the drafting of the written description\nand claims, who then tries in front of a lay judge to shoehorn an accused infringer into claims that usually do not fit (or\nelse claim construction and infringement would not be at issue).\n\nHired “experts,” supporting the parties' theories of infringement or non-infringement take positions that are also distinct\nand isolated from (and often different from) those originally taken by the inventor and attorney, who knew what the\ninvention was and what positions were taken in the Patent Office during prosecution. Thus, the problem lies, not with lack\nof deference to district court interpretation of claims by the Federal Circuit, but to the multiplicity of actors contending\nin a competitive economy. The actors striving to deal with a patent in district court are often not those who made the\ninvention, created the patent, and hence knew exactly what it meant. The solution does not lie in depriving the one\ninstitution charged with ensuring uniformity of part of its authority.\n\nMuch criticism has been directed at this court for allegedly ignoring all the fine work of district court judges in construing\npatent claims. That criticism is premised on the misperception that we do not give a district court's claim construction\nany deference.  *1294  That is incorrect; perhaps one even might say “clearly erroneous.”\n\nThe rubric governing issues of law unfortunately does read “no deference.” But even though we all know that the rubric\ngoverning procedural errors is the harsh “abuse of discretion” language, all judges know that a finding of a procedural\nerror does not normally justify the term “abuse.” Similarly, the “no deference” language is simply established legal jargon\nfor a holding that, having reviewed the record, we disagree. It has been stated in some amicus briefs before the court\nthat there are truly factual issues involved in claim construction, particularly what a claim term meant to one skilled in\nthe art at a particular time, and that such a determination should be given deference. But we should not complicate the\nlaw and change our precedent for such a situation. This court should rarely overturn a district court's claim construction\non a finding of that nature.\n\nThis appellate court, when asked to interpret the claims of a patent carefully, notes and considers how the district court\nconstrued the claims. If we disagree, it is not without a degree of informal deference. Claims are to be interpreted in light\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n20\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nof the written description in the patent specification, and in light of the prosecution. The choice of expert witnesses by\nparties' counsel, and their demeanor, do not override those basic documents. Very few scientists called as expert witnesses\nwill lie, hence the term “credibility,” useful in more conventional fact determinations, such as whether a traffic light was\nred or not, should not be controlling in construing claim limitations in a patent.\n\nClaim construction is analogous to interpretation of other legal instruments, such as contracts and legislation. Each of\nthese determinations is for the court, not a jury, although each can be found to contain factual components (it should be\nnoted though that, at least in patent prosecution, the intent of neither the inventor-attorney nor the patent examiner is\nusually at issue in claim construction). Thus, beyond what the Court has held in Markman, there is good analogical basis\nfor considering claim construction as similar to interpretation of these other legal instruments. Moreover, to the extent\nthat underlying considerations create the “mongrel” nature of claim construction, considering factual components to\nbe subject to deference under a clearly erroneous rule would implicate the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial on\nfactual questions. Such a procedure would further threaten the uniformity that Congress intended in setting up this court\nas well as the Supreme Court's ruling that claim construction is not for the jury.\n\nWhat the proponents of splitting construction into legal and factual issues are in essence contending for is that some\nissues in patent infringement are for the judge (some claim construction issues), some are also for the judge, but are of a\nfactual nature, ordinarily as for a jury, and some clearly for the jury, i.e., infringement. However, in claim construction,\nsimpler is better—claim construction in all its aspects for the judge, subject to review by the appellate court, with sensible\nreliance on the prior work of the trial judge. Creating a formal distinction between fact-sounding issues subordinate to\nclaim construction and the ultimate claim construction is a complication that we should not foist on this court.\n\nA further point is that ultimately it should not matter whether claim construction has a factual component to which\nformal deference attaches or not. If, as I believe we should, and do, give proper informal deference to the work of judges\nof a subordinate tribunal, then we will or  *1295  should affirm when affirmance is appropriate. If, on the other hand,\nwe were to apply a more formal clearly erroneous standard, judgments of subordinate courts are still not unreviewable.\nIf we were to find that the so-called factual component, based on our review of the intrinsic record, has been determined\nincorrectly, clearly we could find it to be incorrect even with a clearly erroneous standard. Thus, this is an argument\nthat should not much matter.\n\nMoreover, to the extent we were to overrule Cybor, or modify it, and give formal deference to district courts, but reserve\nthe right to decide the ultimate issues of obviousness and validity as questions of law, we would be engaging in a kind of\nsham, giving with one hand and taking back with the other. Doing so would bow to what amounts to a cosmetic public,\nor judicial, exercise in order to overcome the harsh rubric of “no deference.”\n\nTo the extent that critics assert that de novo review has not achieved the goal of uniformity, I believe that deferring to\ndistrict court judges on subsidiary, extrinsic fact-related issues, and relying on experts hired for having positions favorable\nto particular parties would likely result in even less uniformity. At least under our current regime, claim construction in\nall its aspects is reviewed by one appellate court. And providing formal deference to district courts in evaluating fact-\nrelated issues would encourage migration away from reliance on the intrinsic written record of the patent specification\nand its prosecution history.\n\nOne should also make no mistake about it: if deference were to be given to rulings on complicated subject matter, intensive\nappellate review would fade away (how many appeals from the PTO are now reversed following Zurko's increase in the\ndegree of deference given to the relatively expert examining agency?), and so will uniformity. In addition, if determining\nwhether an issue is fact or law would determine the degree of deference granted, parties would be arguing over that\nquestion, as in appeals in veterans cases, rather than the real merits of claim construction. As for the relatively high\nreversal rate of claim construction at this court, I very much doubt that it is primarily due to so-called issues of historical\nfact; they are primarily due to our court's review of the claims in light of the specification, not to failure to judge the\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Besides, the reversal rate on claim construction is apparently coming down.\nSee J. Jonas Anderson & Peter S. Menell, Informal Deference: An Historical, Empirical, and Normative Analysis of Patent\nClaim Construction, 108 Nw. U.L.Rev. ––––, 1 (forthcoming 2014).\n\nThis case did not involve subsidiary findings resolving disputes of historical fact. What was involved was whether there\nwas corresponding structure to support “voltage source means” for “providing a constant or variable magnitude DC\nvoltage between the DC input terminals”. The panel found the means clause in the claim lacked sufficient structure, and\nthe specification similarly was lacking, so it reversed the district court on the ground that the claims were indefinite.\nHistorical fact-finding was not involved; reading the claims and written description was. The en banc court should arrive\nat the same conclusion, as the district court did not rely on any subsidiary findings of fact. How a means plus function\nterm is construed under § 112, ¶ 6 is not fact, but claim construction, i.e., law.\n\nFor the above reasons, in addition to the majority's reliance on the doctrine of stare decisis, I support the court's decision\nnot to overrule Cybor.\n\n*1296  O'MALLEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom RADER, Chief Judge, REYNA and WALLACH, Circuit\nJudges, join.\nDistrict judges, both parties in this case, and the majority of intellectual property lawyers and academics around the\ncountry will no doubt be surprised by today's majority opinion—and for good reason. The majority opinion is surprising\nbecause it refuses to acknowledge what experience has shown us and what even a cursory reading of the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996), confirms:\nconstruing the claims of a patent at times requires district courts to resolve questions of fact. And, it puts itself at odds\nwith binding congressional and Supreme Court authority when it refuses to abide by the requirements of Rule 52(a)(6)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which expressly instructs that, on appeal, all “findings of fact ... must not be\nset aside unless clearly erroneous.” It is also surprising because, having, for the third time, invited a broad swath of the\nintellectual property community to express opinions regarding the merits of Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies, Inc., 138\nF.3d 1448 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc), we now premise our refusal to change its holding on principles of stare decisis—\nthat, and a professed inability to come up with a workable alternative to de novo review. 1\n\nCriticism of and debate over Cybor have been widespread since it issued—not only among legal scholars and patent\npractitioners, but also among members of this court. Despite this fact, the majority suggests, for the first time in the\nongoing debate over it, that Cybor is too firmly established in our case law to be rethought. In fact, it appears that some\nmembers of today's 6–4 majority believe the pull of stare decisis is so strong that it prevents them from acting on their\nlong-term convictions that Cybor was wrongly decided. No reasoned application of stare decisis principles supports that\nconclusion.\n\nTo the extent the majority is motivated not just by a resistance to change, but by concern over what standard we should\nchange to, those concerns can be allayed by reference to Rule 52(a)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the\nSupreme Court's case law governing that rule, and a realistic assessment of what the claim construction process entails.\n\nBecause principles of stare decisis do not justify retention of the rule of Cybor and the appropriate standard of review\nis dictated by Rule 52(a), I respectfully dissent.\n\nI.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nIn  Cybor,  this  court  held  that  claim  construction,  “including  any  allegedly  fact-based  questions  relating  to  claim\nconstruction,” presents “a purely legal question” subject to de novo review. Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1456. We reached that\nconclusion even though, in Markman, the Supreme Court repeatedly acknowledged the factual component of claim\nconstruction. There, the Court: (1) labeled claim construction as a “mongrel practice,” (2) suggested that construing\na patent's claims “falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact,” (3) indicated that\n“there could be a case in which a simple credibility judgment would suffice to choose between experts whose testimony\nwas equally consistent with a patent's internal logic,” (4) discussed the need “to ascertain whether an expert's proposed\n*1297  definition fully comports with the specification and claims,” and (5) described claim construction's “evidentiary\nunderpinnings.” Markman, 517 U.S. at 378, 388–90, 116 S.Ct. 1384 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite being urged to do so by both parties, the Patent and Trademark Office, and multiple amici, the majority refuses\nto overturn Cybor. 2  The majority rests its judgment primarily on the principles of stare decisis. It asserts that our fifteen\nyears of experience with Cybor teach that our continued de novo review of all claim construction determinations is needed\nto assure greater “reliability of outcome” and “interjurisdictional uniformity.” Maj. Op. at 1280, 1281.\n\nConsiderations of stare decisis, however, do not justify adhering to precedent that misapprehends the Supreme Court's\nguidance, contravenes the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and adds considerable uncertainty and expense to patent\nlitigation.\n\nII.\n\nStare decisis is an important part of our jurisprudence, and departing from our precedent is not something we should\ndo lightly. The doctrine “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters\nreliance  on  judicial  decisions,  and  contributes  to  the  actual  and  perceived  integrity  of  the  judicial  process.”  Payne\nv.  Tennessee,  501  U.S.  808,  827,  111  S.Ct.  2597,  115  L.Ed.2d  720  (1991).  It  also  serves  to  guard  against  “arbitrary\ndiscretion.” Hubbard v. United States, 514 U.S. 695, 711, 115 S.Ct. 1754, 131 L.Ed.2d 779 (1995) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n“Stare decisis is not an inexorable command[, however]; rather it ‘is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula\nof  adherence  to  the  latest  decision.’  ”  Payne,  501  U.S.  at  828,  111  S.Ct.  2597  (quoting  Helvering  v.  Hallock,  309\nU.S.  106,  119,  60  S.Ct.  444,  84  L.Ed.  604  (1940)).  Its  force  varies  from  case  to  case,  moreover—carrying  the  most\nweight where reliance interests are at stake, but the least weight where the departure from precedent would not change\nsubstantive rights and would “not affect the way in which parties order their affairs.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S.\n223, 233, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009); see also Payne, 501 U.S. at 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597. “Revisiting precedent\nis particularly appropriate where ... a departure would not upset expectations ... and experience has pointed up the\nprecedent's shortcomings.” Pearson, 555 U.S. at 233, 129 S.Ct. 808. The Supreme Court has noted that departing from\nprecedent especially is appropriate “when governing decisions ... are badly reasoned.” Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct.\n2597 (“[W]hen governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned, ‘this Court has never felt constrained to follow\nprecedent.’ ” (quoting Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 665, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944))); see also Helvering, 309\nU.S. at 119, 60 S.Ct. 444 (cautioning against blindly applying stare decisis when adhering to precedent would “involve[ ]\ncollision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience”).\n\nConsistent with this Supreme Court guidance, we have explained that stare decisis does not stand in the way of abrogating\n*1298   our  case  law—even  entire  bodies  of  it—in  at  least  three  circumstances:  when  we  conclude  our  case  law  (1)\nwas  wrongly  decided,  see,  e.g.,  Wilson  v.  United  States,  917  F.2d  529,  536  (Fed.Cir.1990)  (en  banc);  (2)  is  at  odds\nwith  congressional  directives,  see,  e.g.,  Akamai  Technologies,  Inc.  v.  Limelight  Networks,  Inc.,  692  F.3d  1301,  1318\n(Fed.Cir.2012) (en banc); or (3) has had negative consequences, see, e.g., Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649\nF.3d 1276, 1288 (Fed.Cir.2011) (en banc). With these principles in mind, this court has not hesitated to revisit its own\nprecedent. See, e.g., Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., 576 F.3d 1348 (Fed.Cir.2009) (en banc); In re\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

United States, 402 F.3d 1167 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en\nbanc); Knorr–Bremse Systeme Fuer Nutzfahrzeuge GmbH v. Dana Corp., 383 F.3d 1337 (Fed.Cir.2004) (en banc). Indeed,\nwe have said that it is “ ‘[t]he province and obligation of the en banc court ... to review the current validity of challenged\nprior decisions.’ ” Robert Bosch, LLC v. Pylon Mfg. Corp., 719 F.3d 1305, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2013) (en banc) (quoting United\nStates v. Aguon, 851 F.2d 1158, 1167 n. 5 (9th Cir.1988) (en banc)). And, we have made clear that this includes overturning\nprecedent set by this court en banc when appropriate. See Nobelpharma USA, Inc. v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141\nF.3d 1059, 1068 (Fed.Cir.1998) (overruling Atari, Inc. v. JS & A Grp., Inc., 747 F.2d 1422 (Fed.Cir.1984) (en banc), by\n“chang[ing] our precedent and hold [ing] that whether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a\npatentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws is to be decided as a question of Federal Circuit law”).\n\nThus, both Supreme Court case law and our own teach that it is in cases like this one that stare decisis is weakest.\n\nIII.\n\nReversing Cybor will not “upset settled expectations on anyone's part.” Pearson, 555 U.S. at 233, 129 S.Ct. 808. The one\nthing clear about Cybor is that no one in the legal community—except perhaps the members of the majority—has come\nto believe that either the wisdom or vitality of Cybor is settled. Whether one urges the retention of the holding in Cybor\n(as do some amici) or urges its revision (as do the parties, the Patent and Trademark Office, and the rest of the amici),\nit is hard to dispute that tumult has surrounded Cybor since it was decided. During its short life, Cybor repeatedly has\nbeen criticized as poorly reasoned. That criticism has come from members of this court, from district court judges, and\nfrom academics and practitioners across the country.\n\nOur internal debate over Cybor has been heated, and has not abated over time. There were several ardent detractors\nfrom the rule announced in Cybor at the time it was announced. See, e.g., Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1478, 1480 (Newman, J.,\nadditional views) (“By continuing the fiction that there are no facts to be found in claim interpretations, we confound\nrather than ease the litigation process.... However, the Supreme Court has relieved us of adherence to this fiction, by its\nrecognition of the factual component of claim interpretation.”), id. at 1463 (Mayer, C.J., concurring in the judgment)\n(stating that the Cybor majority opinion “profoundly misapprehends” the Supreme Court's decision in Markman ); id.\nat 1473 (Rader, J., dissenting from the pronouncements on claim interpretation in the en banc opinion, concurring in\nthe judgment, and joining part IV of the en banc opinion). Even some of the less vocal critics who concurred in the\nresult in Cybor expressed hesitation regarding the wisdom of either  *1299  the rule established or the legitimacy of its\nunderpinnings. See id. at 1463 (Plager, J., concurring) (“Whether this approach to patent litigation will in the long run\nprove beneficial remains to be seen.”); see also id. at 1463 (Bryson, J., concurring) (“[W]e approach the legal issue of claim\nconstruction recognizing that with respect to certain aspects of the task, the district court may be better situated than we\nare, and that as to those aspects we should be cautious about substituting our judgment for that of the district court.”).\n\nSince Cybor, our internal debate has continued. In Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc),\nthe order granting rehearing en banc asked the parties to address whether it is “appropriate for this court to afford\nany  deference  to  any  aspects  of  trial  court  claim  construction  rulings.”  Id.  at  1328.  Despite  receiving  considerable\ninput from the parties and amici, the Phillips majority, without explanation, “decided not to address that issue at this\ntime.”  Id.  In  dissent,  however,  Judge  Mayer  levied  a  pointed  criticism  of  Cybor,  (1)  discussing  “the  absurdity[  ]  of\nthis court's persistence in adhering to the falsehood that claim construction is a matter of law devoid of any factual\ncomponent,” (2) stating that, “[i]n our quest to elevate our importance, we have ... disregarded our role as an appellate\ncourt ... undermin[ing] the legitimacy of the process, if not the integrity of the institution,” and (3) observing that “we\nare obligated by Rule 52(a) to review the factual findings of the district court that underlie the determination of claim\nconstruction for clear error.” Id. at 1330, 1332 (Mayer, J., dissenting).\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nWe have revisited the question multiple times since then: (1) in 2006 in Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.,\n469 F.3d 1039 (Fed.Cir.2006); (2) in 2011 in Retractable Technologies, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 659 F.3d 1369\n(Fed.Cir.2011); and (3) even as recently as a year ago in Highmark, Inc. v. Allcare Health Management Systems, Inc., 701\nF.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir.2012), where questions of claim construction were not even at issue. See, e.g., Amgen, 469 F.3d at\n1043 (Newman, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc) (“The Federal Circuit's position that patent interpretation\nrequires more rigorous appellate review than other fact/law issues has not withstood the test of experience. It is time\nto reopen the question and to rethink, en banc, the optimum approach to accuracy, consistency, and predictability in\nthe resolution of patent disputes....”); id. at 1046 n. 3 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc) (highlighting\nthe problems Cybor has caused for district courts attempting to construe patent claims); id. at 1045 (Gajarsa, Linn, &\nDyk, JJ., concurring in denial of reh'g en banc) (noting that the concurrence “should not be read as ... an unqualified\nendorsement of the en banc decision in Cybor ”); Retractable Techs., 659 F.3d at 1373 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial\nof reh'g en banc) (“The Supreme Court held that claim construction was a ‘mongrel practice.’ As such it is clearly a\nmixed question of law and fact and deference should be given to the factual parts.... [W]e must acknowledge the factual\nunderpinnings of this analysis and there should be deference.” (citation omitted)); Highmark, 701 F.3d at 1362 (Moore,\nJ., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc) (citing to Cybor and stressing that “[w]e need to avoid the temptation to label\neverything legal and usurp the province of the fact finder with our manufactured de novo review”).\n\nNotably, not once during this internal dialogue over the rule promulgated in Cybor did anyone contend that stare decisis\nalone should put an end to our debate. Two members of the current majority have been among the harshest critics of\nCybor  *1300  —contending on multiple, and even recent, occasions that it was poorly reasoned, impractical, and should\nbe reversed. A third conceded that Cybor's rule may be too broad and perhaps should not apply where, as here, the trial\ncourt was forced to resort to extrinsic evidence to assess the meaning of claim terms. In none of their discussions of Cybor\nwas concern regarding stare decisis raised. It certainly was never exalted to the hard stop on further consideration of\nCybor's merits that the majority now finds it to be.\n\nAnd, the debate over Cybor has not all been internal to our court. The external debate has been both consistent and\nwidespread. See, e.g., Amicus Br. of United States, Retractable Techs., Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., No. 11–1154,\n2012 WL 5940288, at *20–21 (U.S. Nov. 28, 2012) (setting out the Solicitor General's observation that (1) “some claim-\nconstruction decisions will depend on a district court's resolution of factual questions,” (2) this court's “decision in Cybor\ndoes not identify any reason that such factual findings should not be given the deference ordinarily required by Federal\nRule of Civil procedure 52(a),” and (3) “appellate courts routinely defer to factual findings made by district courts and\njuries”). District judges have opposed de novo review, describing it as ill conceived and illogical. See, e.g., Amgen, Inc.\nv. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 339 F.Supp.2d 202, 226 n. 23 (D.Mass.2004) (describing the “conundrum” our claim\nconstruction jurisprudence has created by “discouraging resort to extrinsic evidence while at the same time urging courts\nto begin claim construction by considering the plain and customary meaning of a term as understood by one skilled in\nthe art ”); Judge James F.

L.J. 59, 71 (2001) (“In\nMarkman II, the Supreme Court did concede that there are factual underpinnings to claim construction determinations,\nraising the logical question of whether de novo review is the appropriate standard.” (footnote omitted)).\n\nIn  short,  the  only  expectation  about  Cybor  that  appears  “settled”  is  the  expectation  that  one  day  this  court  might\nrecognize  that  Cybor  is  inconsistent  with  Supreme  Court  precedent,  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  and  the\npractical realities involved in the claim construction process, and would reverse it.\n\nParties do not make claim drafting decisions based on the standard of review we apply to trial court claim constructions.\nNor could they given the panel-dependent nature of our own determinations. See Donald R. Dunner, A Retrospective\nof the Federal Circuit's First 25 Years, 17 Fed. Cir. B.J. 127, 130 (2007) (noting that many believe “that Federal Circuit\npredictability is not what it should be and that its decisions are often panel-dependent and result-oriented”); R.

L.Rev.  1105,  1112  (2004)  (“Our  findings  ...  indicate  that  claim  construction  at  the  Federal  Circuit  is  panel\ndependent.”). It is difficult to accept the proposition that our claim construction jurisprudence is a measure against which\nlitigants make important business or innovation decisions. Claim construction disputes are very fact specific—patents\ndo not follow a formulaic structure, or even contain oft repeated language. Claims are drafted, redrafted, and amended\nin ways intended to reflect and capture particular inventions in a particular field, to avoid very specific prior art, and to\nrespond to the rejections of the unique patent examiner involved in the application process. It is rare that any two claims\nwe review contain the same phrasing, and even more rare that the context in which the phrasing is used would not alter\nthe meaning of even almost identical words. 3  Compare Baldwin  *1302  Graphic Sys., Inc. v.

In short, it need not be followed because its premises are wrong. See Wilson, 917 F.2d\nat 536 (overruling precedent that misconstrued congressional intent).\n\nAs noted above, Cybor misapprehends the Supreme Court's decision in Markman, ignoring numerous instances where\nthe Court acknowledged that claim construction can present factual questions. The Supreme Court did not base its\nconclusion on the fact that a patent is a legal instrument whose construction presents a pure question of law. If it had, there\nwould have been no need for the Court to conduct such a thorough analysis of whether the Seventh Amendment required\na jury to resolve issues of claim construction. That question would have needed no discussion if claim construction were\npurely an issue of law because juries have never been tasked with resolving purely legal questions. See Markman, 517\nU.S. at 376–84, 116 S.Ct. 1384; see also Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1464 (Mayer, C.J., concurring in the judgment) (“Though it\ncould have done so easily, the Court chose not to accept our formulation of claim construction: as a pure question of\nlaw to be decided de novo in all cases on appeal. If it had, there would have been no need for its extensive exegesis about\nthe Seventh Amendment and whether juries must construe claims that have evidentiary underpinnings or whether the\nimportance of uniformity is best served by giving these evidentiary questions of meaning to a judge.” (footnote omitted)).\n\nWhile Cybor dismissed Markman's discussion of the factual aspects of claim construction as mere “prefatory comments,”\n138 F.3d at 1455, and insisted that, under Markman, claim construction is a completely legal exercise subject to de novo\nreview, id. at 1456, that conclusion does not flow from Markman. There, the Supreme Court not only acknowledged\nclaim  *1303  construction's factual aspects, it also said nothing to suggest that a de novo standard of review would\nbe appropriate. See Retractable Techs., 659 F.3d at 1373 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc) (“The\nSupreme Court held that claim construction was a ‘mongrel practice.’ As such it is clearly a mixed question of law and\nfact and deference should be given to the factual parts.” (citation omitted)). Markman's holding was limited to the Court's\ndetermination “that the construction of a patent, including terms of art within its claims, is exclusively within the province\nof the court.” Markman, 517 U.S. at 372, 116 S.Ct. 1384. There are many circumstances in which trial judges act as\ntriers of both fact and law; in all of those, deference to the factual components of that decision-making is undoubtedly\ndue. “Stating that something is better decided by the judge is not the same as saying it is a matter of law.” Highmark,\n701 F.3d at 1362 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc). 4  And even saying something is a matter of law\ndoes not answer the question of the standard of review an appellate court should apply. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487\nU.S. 552, 560, 562, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (observing that, “[i]n some cases, such as the present one, the\nattorney's fee determination will involve a judgment ultimately based on a purely legal issue governing the litigation,”\nbut concluding that “sound judicial administration counsels[ ] deferential review of a district court's decision regarding\nattorney's fees” despite its legal character).\n\nThose amici who find great significance in the Supreme Court's citation to Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 106 S.Ct.\n445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985), in Markman miss the mark. That citation does not, as those amici claim, decide the fact/\nlaw question or the question of the appropriate level of appellate review of claim construction determinations. In Miller,\nthe Supreme Court concluded that the ultimate question of whether a confession was sufficiently voluntary to comport\nwith  due  process,  while  a  mixed  question  of  fact  and  law,  was  subject  to  independent  federal  review.  As  the  Court\nnoted in Markman, it had concluded in Miller that, where a question “falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard\nand a simple historical fact,” the conclusion as to which judicial actor is best positioned to decide a question at times\nturns on the sound administration of justice, rather than a pure fact/law distinction. 517 U.S. at 388, 116 S.Ct. 1384.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nThough, in Miller, the Court decided that the sound administration of justice supported the conclusion that the ultimate\nconstitutional question of whether a confession was voluntary should be reserved for federal, rather than state, courts,\nMiller says nothing about the standard of  *1304  review one federal tribunal should apply to the inquiries of another,\nor how the sound administration of justice would divvy up the responsibility of claim construction as between the trial\nand appellate courts.\n\nIn fact, in Miller itself, the Court concluded that a presumption of correctness still must be afforded to all “subsidiary\nfactual questions” decided by the state courts. 474 U.S. at 112, 106 S.Ct. 445. And, the Court was careful to explain that\nits determination of what the sound administration of justice called for vis-à-vis the federal and state courts was reached\nin the absence of congressional directives to the contrary.\n\nIn Markman, the Supreme Court said that judicial efficiencies supported allocation of claim construction determinations\nto the court rather than the jury. It did not say that “subsidiary factual determinations” made by trial courts ceased to be\nsubject to the deference congressionally mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, however. And, it did not say\nthat it was this court and only this court to which the question should be allocated. Indeed, in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx\nCorp., 496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), decided five years after Markman, the Court addressed the\nquestion of how the sound administration of justice can impact the standard of review of questions that involve both\nfactual and legal components. There, while the Court acknowledged that some purely legal inquiries are involved in\ndeterminations pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it found that the entire determination must\nbe reviewed by the courts of appeals under an abuse of discretion standard. Id. at 403–04, 110 S.Ct. 2447. Returning\nto the same type of inquiry employed in Miller, the Supreme Court explained that where, as in a Rule 11 inquiry, the\nline between fact and law is difficult to divine and the trier of fact needs flexibility to decide unique facts that resist\ngeneralization, it is the trial judge who is the judicial actor best suited to decide the question. Id. In such instances, the\nCourt found that the sound administration of justice to which it harkened in Miller and again in Markman mandated\na fully deferential standard of review.\n\nIt is notable that at least one Supreme Court Justice on the Court when Markman was decided believes that, if Markman\ncan be said to have decided the standard of review to be applied to claim construction determinations, it decided that\nquestion very differently than we did in Cybor and than we continue to do today. In Gasperini v. Center for Humanities,\nInc., 518 U.S. 415, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996), dissenting from the judgment there, Justice Stevens described\nthe Court's decision in Markman as one of three that term in which courts of appeals were “assigned ... the task of\nindependently reviewing similarly mixed questions of law and fact,” and described the nature of that review as one in\nwhich appellate courts are required “to construe all record inferences in favor of the factfinder's decision and then to\ndetermine whether, on the facts found below, the legal standard has been met.” Id. at 442–43, 116 S.Ct. 2211 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting).\n\nMarkman's citation to Miller, accordingly, lends no support to the notion that Markman somehow dictated the result in\nCybor. It only helped explain why the court, rather than the jury, was chosen as the appropriate decision maker. Cybor\nwas not compelled by the Supreme Court's guidance; as explained in section V below, it is actually a wide departure\nfrom it.\n\nCybor also ignores the realities of the claim construction process. As our en banc court in Phillips observed:\n\n*1305  [B]ecause extrinsic evidence can help educate the court regarding the field of the invention\nand can help the court determine what a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand claim\nterms to mean, it is permissible for the district court in its sound discretion to admit and use such\nevidence. In exercising that discretion, and in weighing all the evidence bearing on claim construction,\nthe court should keep in mind the flaws inherent in each type of evidence and assess that evidence\naccordingly.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Cybor cannot be squared with this court's own well-respected description of the very\nclaim construction process to which it purports to apply.\n\nThe majority concedes that claims are to be interpreted from the perspective of one of skill in the art at the time of the\ninvention unless it appears from the surrounding record—the specification and prosecution history—that the patentee\nacted as his own lexicographer to provide a contrary meaning. Maj. Op. at 1289 (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314). It\nconcludes, however, that all we need to put ourselves into the shoes of a skilled artisan are the patent documents and,\nperhaps (though not necessarily), some explanation regarding the technology at issue and a dictionary or treatise. It\nbelieves we do not need to hear from experts regarding the state of the known science or art at the time of the invention,\nthe commonly understood meaning, if any, of the particular terms or phrases employed, the level of education and skill\none reading such a patent would have, or whether there are particular treatises or dictionaries to which a skilled artisan\nwould have turned at the time. See id. at 1284. And, it believes that the conclusions it gleans from the patent documents,\nincluding the entirety of the prosecution history, expert descriptions of the technology, and dictionaries are all legal\nconclusions; that no finding made by any judicial officer in the process of claim construction constitutes a subsidiary\nfactual one. See id. at 1284–85.\n\nThe majority justifies these conclusions by analogizing the claim construction process to the interpretation of statutes,\nwhere courts routinely consider contemporaneous dictionaries or even the testimony of historians to help determine the\nmeaning of words and phrases therein. See id. The analogy is not a sound one, however.\n\nStatutes are duly enacted laws of broad applicability. Their interpretation by an appellate court is binding on all who\nwould be impacted by that statute in that circuit, whether parties to the original action or not. They are drafted by\nthose with congressional authority to enact such laws and are to be given a meaning common to all. Patents are drafted\nex parte, are revised in a closed-door examination process, their terms are, as noted before, unique to the invention at\nissue, and are assertable only against individual infringers in private actions. The two are simply not of the same ilk. See\nMarkman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 998 n. 8 (Fed.Cir.1995) (Mayer, J., concurring in the judgment)\n(“Patents cannot be baby statutes....”); Amgen, 469 F.3d at 1040–41 (Michel, C.J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc)\n(observing that, in statutory interpretation, a judge construes terms from the perspective of a skilled legal artisan looking\nat the words only, not from the perspective of a different individual—one skilled in the relevant field of technology in\nlight of the intrinsic and extrinsic record).\n\nThe parties agree that there were disputed factual questions in this case that required examination of extrinsic evidence. In\nthe proceedings before the district court and again on appeal, the parties  *1306  disputed whether the claim term “voltage\nsource means” should be treated as a means-plus-function limitation under 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 6. Lighting Ballast Control\nLLC v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., 498 Fed.Appx. 986, 989–90 (Fed.Cir.2013). The use of the word “means” triggers\nthe presumption that the limitation is a means-plus-function term, but that presumption “may be rebutted if the claim\nitself recites sufficient structure for performing the function.” Id. at 990. The parties focused on whether “voltage source\nmeans” denoted a particular structure to those of skill in the art (i.e., whether the term had a specific meaning used by\nthose of skill in the art to describe a defined structure or specific class of structures). See id. If skilled artisans understood\n“voltage source means” to refer to a defined structure, it would not be considered a means-plus-function limitation.\nId. The specification and prosecution history, however, did not resolve the question. Thus, it became necessary and\nappropriate to look outside the intrinsic record and to consider the testimony of Lighting Ballast's expert, Dr. Roberts.\nSee id.; see also Rembrandt Data Techs., LP v. AOL, LLC, 641 F.3d 1331, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2011) (“When determining\nwhether a claim term recites sufficient structure, we examine whether it has an understood meaning in the art.”). When\nsituations like this arise, it is appropriate—and sometimes necessary—to make findings based on extrinsic evidence that\nrelate to the meaning of a disputed term. Resolution of these fact-intensive disputes is an area where district courts'\nexpertise deserves the deference that Rule 52(a)(6) requires.\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nBoth parties, the PTO, and most amici agree that there are factual components to claim construction. Even among the\namici that favor retaining Cybor's de novo review of all aspects of claim construction, most readily identified factual\nquestions that arise during claim construction. Microsoft Corp., for instance, advocated retaining Cybor, but nonetheless\nlisted numerous factual questions that it concedes could arise during claim construction and would require the court to:\n\ndetermin[e] the field[s] of the invention and the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in\nthe art; determin[e] the art-accepted meanings of terms used in an issued claim and also used in\nthe specification and/or prior art; determin[e] the date of the invention and/or the effective filing\ndate  of  the  patent  application;  determin[e]  whether  a  proposed  construction  would  exclude  all\nembodiments in the specification or, conversely, whether any embodiment supports the construed\nissued  claim;  identifying  explicit  or  implicit  definitions  in  the  specification;  [and]  determin[e]\nthe  disclosure  of  cited  prior  art  references  (which  are  part  of  the  ‘intrinsic  evidence’  for  claim\nconstruction) asserted as invalidating prior art and/or distinguished in the prosecution history.\n\nAmicus Br. at 4–5. Similarly, the Austin Intellectual Property Law Association observed that “district courts are charged\nwith taking evidence of specialized meanings in ... patent interpretation.” Amicus Br. at 8. Likewise, the brief filed by\nCisco Systems, Inc. et al. acknowledged that a case could arise where “a question of meaning peculiar to a trade or\nprofession [could] turn[ ] on the resolution of contested questions of historical fact.” Amicus Br. at 24–26 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn sum, it is hard to understand how either the majority in Cybor or the majority here can dispute that claim construction\nsometimes requires a district court to resolve contested factual issues. Cybor is, thus, based on a faulty premise—that\nclaim construction is a purely legal exercise.  *1307  This reveals deep flaws in Cybor's reasoning, justifying a departure\nfrom it. See Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597 (permitting departure from decisions that prove “unworkable or\nare badly reasoned”).\n\nV.\n\nStare decisis also must give way because, by refusing to acknowledge the factual component of claim construction, Cybor\ncontravenes the clear directives of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6). When a district court makes findings of fact\n—as claim construction sometimes requires—Rule 52(a)(6) provides clear instructions to this court: “Findings of fact,\nwhether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous....” The rule is clear on its face,\nand decisions interpreting it show that it makes no exception with regard to fact-finding in the claim construction context.\nAs the Supreme Court has observed, “Rule 52(a) broadly requires that findings of fact not be set aside unless clearly\nerroneous. It does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings from the obligation\nof a court of appeals to accept a district court's findings unless clearly erroneous.” Pullman–Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S.\n273, 287, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982); see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 498,\n104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (“We have repeatedly held that ... Rule [52(a) ] means what it says.”). Thus, there\nis direct conflict between Cybor—which expressly calls for de novo review of “any allegedly fact-based questions relating\nto claim construction,” 138 F.3d at 1456—and Rule 52(a)(6)—which requires deference to all fact-findings that are not\nclearly erroneous. See Amicus Br. of United States at 9–13 (noting that “[a]ppellate courts must defer to a trial court's\nfactual findings under Rule 52(a)” and that, “[g]iven the clear command of Rule 52(a), no justification exists to treat\nclaim construction any differently”).\n\nThe law governing obviousness confirms Rule 52(a)'s broad applicability in patent disputes. Obviousness presents a\nquestion of law subject to de novo review, but it involves a number of subsidiary fact-findings. As the Supreme Court\nobserved:\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters.

Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nWhile the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law, ... the § 103 condition ... lends itself\nto several basic factual inquiries. Under § 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be\ndetermined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the\nlevel of ordinary skill in the pertinent are resolved.\n\nGraham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). According to the Court,\n“[t]his description of the obviousness inquiry makes it clear that whether or not the ultimate question of obviousness\nis a question of fact subject to Rule 52(a), the subsidiary determinations of the District Court, at the least, ought to be\nsubject to the Rule.” Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475 U.S. 809, 811, 106 S.Ct. 1578, 89 L.Ed.2d 817 (1986); see\nalso Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 810 F.2d 1561, 1569 (Fed.Cir.1987) (“Rule 52(a) is applicable to all findings on\nthe four inquiries listed in Graham: scope and content of prior art; differences between prior art and claimed invention;\nlevel of skill; and objective evidence....”). Importantly, one of the key fact questions in an obviousness inquiry is what\na prior art reference teaches—often, what is claimed and described in a previously issued patent. See Graham, 383 U.S.\nat 17, 86 S.Ct. 684. And, all findings regarding the scope and content of the prior art are subject to clear error review.\n*1308  See Panduit, 810 F.2d at 1569. That we trust jurors to define the scope of patent claims in this context, but are less\nthan comfortable allowing trial judges to do the same when considering the asserted patent claims is at least anomalous.\nCybor is thus out of step with our other jurisprudence that faithfully applies Rule 52(a) in patent cases.\n\nThis conflict between Cybor and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure means our case law must fall. As this court has\nobserved,\n\nThe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  were  promulgated  by  the  Supreme  Court  pursuant  to  statutory  authority\nand were implicitly adopted by Congress after transmission to Congress in their proposed form. See 28 U.S.C. §§\n2071–2074. In light of this statutory promulgation scheme, the Supreme Court has held that the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure are deemed to have “the force [and effect] of a federal statute.”\n\nBright v. United States, 603 F.3d 1273, 1279 (Fed.Cir.2010) (alteration in original) (quoting Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,\n312 U.S. 1, 13, 61 S.Ct. 422, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941)). Our cases dealing with the application of stare decisis where statutory\ninterpretation is at issue thus provide useful guidance.\n\nWe often have held that stare decisis does not prevent our court from overturning its precedent when we conclude our\nprior jurisprudence runs contrary to what we believe are a statute's directives.

As\nthe PTO explains, “Congress gave no indication in the patent laws that it intended to displace the fundamental principle\nof appellate review for clear error.” Amicus Br. of United States at 12. 5\n\nVI.\n\nThe “undesired consequences” flowing from this court's claim construction jurisprudence also justify departing from\nthe law set out in  *1310  Cybor. Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1481 (Newman, J., additional views); see also Pearson, 555 U.S.\nat 233, 129 S.Ct. 808 (stating that revisiting case law is “particularly appropriate” where experience has revealed its\nshortcomings). By refusing to acknowledge the factual component of claim construction, Cybor has made the claim\nconstruction  process  less  transparent,  accurate,  predictable,  and  efficient,  thereby  imposing  high  “social  costs.”  See\nAnderson & Menell, supra, at *60–61; Whitmer, supra, at 16 (lamenting the “high reversal rate” with respect to claim\nconstruction that is the “consequence of the Cybor uncertainty principle”); Lane & Pepe, supra, at 71–73 (examining the\nuncertainty that results from de novo review).\n\nA.\n\nThe  primary  interests  furthered  by  stare  decisis—a  doctrine  rooted  in  policy—support  departing  from  Cybor,  not\nadhering  to  it.  See  Helvering,  309  U.S.  at  119,  60  S.Ct.  444  (observing  that  stare  decisis  “is  a  principle  of  policy”).\nPreserving  the  stability  of  the  law  and  protecting  the  public's  ability  to  “rel[y]  on  judicial  decisions”  are  the  central\ninterests furthered by stare decisis. Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597. By withholding deference to district courts'\nfindings of claim construction facts, however, the interests of stability and predictability are disserved. See Highmark, 701\nF.3d at 1362 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc) (“When we convert factual issues, or mixed questions\n\n © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.\n\n32\n\n\x0cLighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Electronics North..., 744 F.3d 1272 (2014)\n109 U.S.P.Q.2d 1969\n\nof law and fact, into legal ones for our de novo review, we undermine the uniformity and predictability goals this court\nwas designed to advance.”); see also Amicus Br. of Prof. Peter Menell at 15 (observing that “[t]he[ ] effects [of de novo\nreview of claim construction determinations] continue to cast doubt on the predictability of patent litigation, discourage\nsettlements following claim construction trial, delay resolution of patent disputes, and run up the overall costs of patent\nlitigation”). Indeed, our resistance to changing Cybor is directly contrary to the purposes of Rule 52(a)(6): to promote\nstability in the judicial system by (1) avoiding undermining the legitimacy of district courts and (2) preventing unnecessary\nappeals by discouraging appellate retrial of factual issues. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52 advisory committee's note (1985).\n\nUnder the Cybor regime, a district court can construe a claim term, and an entire trial can follow premised on that\nconstruction. When the district court's judgment is appealed, however, we review every aspect of its claim construction\nde novo, leaving us largely free to reinterpret claims—both upsetting parties' expectations and undoing a tremendous\namount of parties' and district courts' work in the process. See Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1476 (Rader, J., dissenting from the\npronouncements on claim interpretation in the en banc opinion) (“To get a certain claim interpretation, parties must go\npast the district court's Markman I proceeding, past the entirety of discovery, past the entire trial on the merits, past post-\ntrial motions, past briefing and argument to the Federal Circuit—indeed past every step in the entire course of federal\nlitigation, except Supreme Court review.”). Once here, moreover, as noted earlier, “[c]ommentators have observed that\nclaim construction appeals are ‘panel dependent’ which leads to frustrating and unpredictable results for both the litigants\nand the trial court.” Retractable Techs., 659 F.3d at 1370 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc) (citations\nomitted). And, while the majority says that it is “no longer true” that there is a high reversal rate with respect to claim\nconstructions by district courts, Majority ""]"
