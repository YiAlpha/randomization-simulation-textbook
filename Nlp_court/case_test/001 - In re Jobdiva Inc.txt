Synopsis
Background: The United States Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, 2015 WL 2170162,
cancelled JOBDIVA service mark in proceeding that owner originally requested to cancel registration owned by another
party, and denied reconsideration, 2015 WL 3542849. Owner appealed.
------------- Layer 9  ---------------
[Holding:] The Court of Appeals, Stoll, Circuit Judge, held that question of whether owner of JOBDIVA service mark,
through its software, performed personnel placement and recruitment services and whether consumers would associate
that mark with personnel placement and recruitment services, regardless of whether steps of service were performed by
software, was factual determination to which bright-line rule could not be applied.

Opinion
------------- Layer 56  ---------------
Stoll, Circuit Judge.
------------- Layer 57  ---------------
In this trademark case, we must decide whether JobDiva, Inc. used its marks in connection with personnel placement
and recruitment services, or whether the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board correctly held that JobDiva failed to do
so because it used its marks on software offerings, without more. The Board required JobDiva to prove that it used its
marks on more than just software because its software sales alone could not, in the Board's view, constitute personnel
and recruitment services. We disagree with the Board's approach. The proper question is whether JobDiva, through its
software, performed personnel placement and recruitment services and whether consumers would associate JobDiva's
registered marks with personnel placement and recruitment services, regardless of whether the steps of the service were
performed by software. Because the Board must visit that question in the first instance, we vacate its decision and remand
for further consideration.

BACKGROUND
------------- Layer 59  ---------------
I.
------------- Layer 60  ---------------
On June 8, 2004, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued Registration No. 2851917 (“the '917 registration”)
to JobDiva for the service mark JOBDIVA for “personnel placement and recruitment” services. On November 8, 2005,
it issued Registration No. 3013235 (“the '235 registration”) to JobDiva for the service mark shown below:
------------- Layer 61  ---------------
for “personnel placement and recruitment services; computer services, namely, providing databases featuring recruitment
and employment, employment advertising, career information and resources, resume creation, resume transmittals and
communication of responses thereto via a global computer network.” J.A. 498; see also J.A. 52–53.
------------- Layer 62  ---------------
JobDiva uses its trademarks in connection with its product and service offerings, which its website describes as “the
largest, ultimate, full service solution for the staffing industry with an extensive suite of products & tools, front to back
end, covering all staffing needs.” J.A. 117. JobDiva offers, in the words of its Chief Executive Officer, “an applicant
tracking system for recruiting departments, [and] for HR departments seeking to staff people.” J.A. 212. JobDiva uses
software to automatically provide these offerings to clients.
------------- Layer 63  ---------------
JobDiva's software generally provides a database of employment applications that a hiring manager or recruiter might
use  to  fill  a  job  opening.  J.A.  223.  The  software  performs  multiple  functions  to  facilitate  this  job-filling  process.  It
employs  automated  “harvesters”  to  find  potential  job  candidates  by  automatically  scraping  job  *938   boards  and
aggregating relevant resumes. J.A. 223, 461–63. And it reviews and analyzes job candidates' resumes to determine if any
candidate's qualifications match the job's requirements. J.A. 393. It thus “replaces a tedious manual search” previously
performed by hiring managers or recruiters. J.A. 462–63. JobDiva also helps hiring managers directly communicate with
job candidates. For instance, it permits hiring managers to post job openings in a job candidate portal. J.A. 221. This
candidate portal may also be embedded into a company's website. J.A. 13. The software further assists job candidates by
recommending potential openings to the candidates based on skillsets and provides them automated resume feedback.

121 U.S.P.Q.2d 1122
------------- Layer 67  ---------------
In many circumstances, JobDiva renders these offerings on a software-as-a-service, or “SaaS,” basis to its customers. As
the Board explained, “Software as a Service (SaaS) leverages software by delivering it over the Internet.” JobDiva, Inc. v.
Jobvite, Inc., Cancellation No. 92050828, 2015 WL 3542849, at *1 (T.T.A.B. May 20, 2015) (“JobDiva Rehearing”). The
Board noted that SaaS is “also known as cloud computing.” Id. at *2. “Cloud computing,” according to the Board, “is
defined as ‘computing operations carried out on servers that are accessed through the Internet, rather than on one's own
personal computers.’ ” Id. at *2 (quoting Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms 434 (11th ed. 2013)). By hosting
its software remotely, JobDiva provides its clients a product without the need to download “cumbersome software ...
onto office desktops or laptops.” J.A. 474.
------------- Layer 68  ---------------
As the Board explained, JobDiva's SaaS model of software delivery also changes the way that users interact with JobDiva:
“The users pay for the computing as a service rather than owning the machines and software to do it.” JobDiva Rehearing,
2015 WL 3542849, at *2 (quoting Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms, supra, at 434). Unlike a locally installed
software program, which might be downloaded from the Internet or a disk, JobDiva's software resides on remote servers
and customers access it via the Internet.
------------- Layer 69  ---------------
II.
------------- Layer 70  ---------------
The Board cancelled JobDiva's marks in a proceeding that JobDiva originally requested. JobDiva initially petitioned
the Board to cancel a registration owned by Jobvite, Inc., which is no longer a party to this case. JobDiva asserted, inter
alia, a likelihood of confusion between Jobvite's and JobDiva's service marks. To establish its claim, JobDiva asserted
ownership of its two marks introduced above.
------------- Layer 71  ---------------
Jobvite counterclaimed, petitioning the Board to cancel JobDiva's trademark registrations by alleging that JobDiva failed
to perform personnel placement and recruitment services. Jobvite requested that the Board cancel the '917 registration in
whole and its '235 registration in part. Notably, Jobvite did not submit affirmative evidence of abandonment or challenge
that JobDiva used the '235 registration to identify the other services specified in its registration.
------------- Layer 72  ---------------
A.
------------- Layer 73  ---------------
The Board granted Jobvite's counterclaim, cancelling the '917 registration in whole and the '235 registration in part.
JobDiva,  Inc.  v.  Jobvite,  Inc.,  Cancellation  No.  92050828,  2015  WL  2170162  (T.T.A.B.  Apr.  16,  2015).  The  Board
explained that under Section 45 of the Trademark Act, “[a] mark shall be deemed to be ‘abandoned’ ... [w]hen its use has
been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.” Id. at *7 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1125).
------------- Layer 74  ---------------
*939  The Board started its analysis of JobDiva's use of its marks by defining the scope of JobDiva's registrations for
“personnel placement and recruitment” services and consulting dictionary definitions for each word. Id. at *6. Combining
these definitions, the Board found that “personnel placement and recruitment” meant “that [JobDiva] is finding and
placing people in jobs at other companies or providing personnel staffing services for others.” Id.
------------- Layer 75  ---------------
To  prove  its  use  of  the  marks  in  connection  with  personnel  placement  and  recruitment,  JobDiva  had  submitted
screenshots  from  its  website  and  a  declaration  of  its  CEO,  Diya  Obeid.  But  the  Board  found  JobDiva's  evidence
insufficient,  explaining  that  “[t]here  [was]  no  reference  ...  to  Petitioner's  performance  of  personnel  placement  and
recruitment  services  other  than  supplying  Petitioner's  software.”  Id.  The  Board  concluded  that,  “[s]ince  there  is  no
evidence of use of Petitioner's marks in connection with ‘personnel placement and recruitment’ services, there has been
nonuse for three consecutive years.” Id. The Board therefore cancelled the '917 registration in whole and amended the
'235 registration to delete “personnel placement and recruitment.” Id.

B.
------------- Layer 80  ---------------
JobDiva  petitioned  the  Board  to  reconsider  its  judgment,  arguing  that  “the  Board  made  erroneous  findings  of  fact
because there is ‘abundant evidence of record’ that shows Petitioner providing the service of ‘finding and placing people
in jobs at other companies or providing personnel staffing services for others.’ ” JobDiva Rehearing, 2015 WL 3542849,
at *1. The Board again disagreed, finding that JobDiva had failed to prove use of its marks for “personnel placement
and recruitment” services.
------------- Layer 81  ---------------
The Board explained that “[a] term that only identifies a computer program does not become a service mark merely
because the program is sold or licensed in commerce.” Id. at *2. “Such a mark does not serve to identify a service unless it
is also used to identify and distinguish the service itself, as opposed to the program.” Id. The Board counseled, however,
that “it is important to review the record carefully to determine the manner of use of the mark and the impression it is
likely to make on purchasers.” Id.
------------- Layer 82  ---------------
The Board found JobDiva's evidence of use insufficient because JobDiva only provided software, but not additional
“personnel placement and recruitment” services. The Board explained that it “looked for evidence that Petitioner was
rendering ‘personnel placement and recruitment services' for others rather than merely providing a software solution for
clients to use in performing their ‘personnel placement and recruitment’ activities.” Id. The Board criticized JobDiva
for  “confus[ing]  the  service  of  providing  a  software  solution  for  personnel  placement  and  recruitment  with  actually
rendering personnel placement and recruitment services.” Id. at *3. The Board repeatedly faulted JobDiva's evidence as
proving only that JobDiva offered software for personnel placement and recruitment, instead of providing that software
in addition to offering personnel placement and recruitment services. Id. at *3–4. Indeed, the Board required JobDiva
to prove that “it is rendering ‘personnel placement and recruitment’ as an independent activity distinct from providing
its software to others.” Id. at *4 (emphasis added).
------------- Layer 83  ---------------
The Board further made clear that JobDiva did not use the marks for services, even though the software itself could
perform  the  “personnel  placement  and  recruitment”  functions.  JobDiva's  CEO  had  *940   testified  that  JobDiva's
software actually performs personnel placement and recruitment services:
------------- Layer 84  ---------------
“JobDiva aggregates resumes for its clients, employers, from the job boards ... they apply to job boards to source
candidates and that is usually a manual exercise,” but JobDiva can “search the job board's sites and databases for
candidates on behalf of employers who are subscribing to these job boards, so it's almost like an outsource function
that JobDiva performs in the recruiting process.”
------------- Layer 85  ---------------
Id. at *3 (quoting J.A. 223). The Board dismissed this evidence, however, because the testimony did “not provide any
evidence that Petitioner renders ‘personnel placement and recruitment services' other than by providing the software
that performs those functions.” Id. Thus, the Board ultimately found that JobDiva had failed to establish “that it is
rendering ‘personnel placement and recruitment’ services for others separate and apart from providing its software.” Id.
(emphasis added).
------------- Layer 86  ---------------
The Board denied JobDiva's request for reconsideration, and JobDiva appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1295(a)(4)(B).

[1] Section 1(a) of the Lanham Act requires that an application to register a trademark must include “specification of ...
the goods in connection with which the mark is used.” 15 U.S.C. § 1051(a). The Supreme Court has recognized that
“[t]he usages listed in [an] application ... are critical” because of, inter alia, the legal rights that trademark registration
conveys. B & B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc., ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1293, 1300, 191 L.Ed.2d 222 (2015). As
such, a registrant must use its mark in accordance with goods and services recited in the registration. 15 U.S.C. § 1064(3);

1087 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Because service mark registrations are presumed valid, the party seeking cancellation of such
registration must “establish[ ] a prima facie case of abandonment by showing proof of nonuse for three consecutive
years.” On–Line Careline, 229 F.3d at 1087. Whether a mark has been used to identify a particular service is a question
of fact. In re Advert. & Mktg. Dev., Inc., 821 F.2d 614, 621 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Likewise, whether a trademark holder has
abandoned its use of a mark is a question of fact. On–Line Careline, 229 F.3d at 1087. We review the Board's legal
conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence. Princeton Vanguard, LLC v. Frito–Lay N. Am.,
Inc., 786 F.3d 960, 964 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
------------- Layer 96  ---------------
We agree with the Board's initial observation that, with modern technology, the line between services and products
sometimes  blurs.  See  JobDiva  Rehearing,  2015  WL  3542849,  at  *2.  As  the  Board  correctly  observed,  “[i]n  today's
commercial context if a customer goes to a company's website and accesses the company's software to conduct some type
of business, the company may be rendering a service, even though the service utilizes software.” Id. (quoting In re Ancor
Holdings, No. 76213721, 2006 WL 1258813 (T.T.A.B. April 28, 2006)). But a mark used with a web-based offering may
equally identify the provision of software, rather than a  *941  service. For these reasons, careful analysis is required to
determine whether web-based offerings, like those JobDiva provides, are products or services: “[I]t is important,” as the
Board properly noted, “to review all the information in the record to understand both how the mark is used and how it
will be perceived by potential customers.” JobDiva Rehearing, 2015 WL 3542849, at *2.
------------- Layer 97  ---------------
But while the Board rightly recognized that it is crucial to carefully review the manner of use of the marks and their
likely impression on purchasers, id. it nevertheless appeared to apply a bright-line rule requiring JobDiva to show that
it performed the “personnel placement and recruitment” services in a way other than having its software perform those
services. It stated, for example, that “there is no testimony or evidence that supports [JobDiva's] claim that it is rendering
‘personnel placement and recruitment’ as an independent activity distinct from providing its software to others.” Id. at
*4 (emphasis added). The Board repeatedly faulted JobDiva for failing to prove that it offered personnel placement and
recruitment services in addition to its provision of software. Id. at *3 (“The references on Petitioner's web sites show that
Petitioner is supplying ‘personnel placement and recruitment’ software, not that Petitioner itself is rendering ‘personnel
placement  and  recruitment’  services  for  others.”);  id.  at  *4  (“Petitioner's  ‘harvesters'  are  functions  or  capabilities  of
the  JobDiva  software,  not  activities  performed  by  Petitioner  for  the  purpose  of  offering  ‘personnel  placement  and
recruitment services' for others.”). In holding JobDiva to that standard, the Board erred in its understanding of the law.
------------- Layer 98  ---------------
Even though a service may be performed by a company's software, the company may well be rendering a service. For
example, in On–Line Careline, we held that AOL had used its ONLINE TODAY mark in connection with services, even
though those services were provided by software. 229 F.3d at 1088. AOL had used its mark in connection with software
that “provided its users with ‘access' to its service through on-screen menu items.” Id. We affirmed the Board's finding
that AOL used its mark to identify the services described in the registration: “providing access to online computer services
offering computer-industry news, commentary and product reviews.” Id. We explained that, “[i]n a very literal sense, the
subject mark was the designation by which AOL provides users access to the Internet news and information service.”
Id. At bottom, we recognized that software may be used by companies to provide services. Id. Indeed, here the '235
registration for “computer services, namely, providing databases featuring recruitment and employment, employment

advertising, career information and resources, resume creation, resume transmittals and communication of responses

------------- Layer 103  ---------------
[6] To determine whether a mark is used in connection with the services described in the registration, a key consideration
is the perception of the user. See Lens.com, Inc. v. 1–800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381–82 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The
question is whether a user would associate the mark with “personnel placement and recruitment” services performed by
JobDiva, even if JobDiva's software performs each of the steps of the service. 1  In other  *942  words, the question is
whether the evidence of JobDiva's use of its marks “sufficiently creates in the minds of purchasers an association between
the mark[s] and [JobDiva's personnel placement and recruitment] services.” Ancor Holdings, 2006 WL 1258813, at *3.
------------- Layer 104  ---------------
This “is a factual determination that must be conducted on a case-by-case basis,” and there are many case-specific factors
the Board might examine. Lens.com, 686 F.3d at 1381–82. For example, in this case, the Board should consider the
nature of the user's interaction with JobDiva when using JobDiva's software, as well as the location of the software host.
If JobDiva sells its software to a customer who hosts the software on its own website and a third-party user's interactions
appear to be with the customer (as opposed to JobDiva), it is unlikely that the customer or the third-party user would
associate the JOBDIVA mark with a service performed by JobDiva. But if the software is hosted on JobDiva's website
such that the user perceives direct interaction with JobDiva during operation of the software, a user might well associate
JobDiva's marks with personnel “placement and recruitment” services performed by JobDiva. The purchasers' acquiring
ownership  in  JobDiva's  software  likely  will  preclude  a  finding  that  JobDiva  has  rendered  services,  unless  JobDiva's
activities after the sale create the perception that JobDiva is in fact providing services.
------------- Layer 105  ---------------
The ultimate question here is this: whether purchasers would perceive JobDiva's marks to identify “personnel placement
and recruitment” services. Because that question is a factual one, the Board must answer it in the first instance.
------------- Layer 106  ---------------
Because the Board applied the wrong legal standard, we vacate its judgment and remand for further consideration in
light of this opinion.

We note that JobDiva, like any entity, may register its marks to identify both software and services performed by software.
37 C.F.R. § 2.86 (“In a single application for a trademark, service mark, and/or collective mark, an applicant may apply to
register the same mark for goods, services, and/or a collective membership organization in multiple classes.”). For example,
JobDiva might use its marks to identify software sold to some customers, but those uses do not somehow negate other uses
of the same marks to identify service offerings.
