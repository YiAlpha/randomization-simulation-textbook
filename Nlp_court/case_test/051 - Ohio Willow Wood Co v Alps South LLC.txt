Synopsis
Background: Owner of patent directed to cushioning devices going over residual stumps of amputated limbs brought
infringement  action  against  competitor.  The  district  court  granted  summary  judgment  to  competitor  on  issues  of
invalidity, and granted patent owner's motion for summary judgment of no inequitable conduct, 2012 WL 2196083,
2012 WL 3283437, and, subsequently, denied patent owner's motion for reconsideration, 2012 WL 3309635. The parties
appealed. The Court of Appeals, 735 F.3d 1333, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. On remand, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Gregory L. Frost, J., 2014 WL 4775374, held that patent was
unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Owner appealed.

BRYSON, Circuit Judge.
------------- Layer 81  ---------------
This case marks the latest chapter in a long-running dispute between two manufacturers of prosthetic limb accessories.
The appellant, The Ohio Willow Wood Company (“OWW”), owns a group of patents directed to cushioning devices
that fit  *1353  over the residual stumps of amputated limbs to make the use of prosthetics more comfortable. OWW
has asserted its patents against defendant Alps South, LLC (“Alps”) in several actions.
------------- Layer 82  ---------------
The cushioning devices at issue in this case consist of stretchable pieces of synthetic fabric that are coated with a gel
on only the side touching the body. That design creates a gel side that reduces irritation to the skin and a dry side that
allows free interaction with the prosthesis.

This case is back before us following an earlier decision remanding a portion of the case for trial. See Ohio Willow Wood
Co. v. Alps S., LLC, 735 F.3d 1333 (Fed.Cir.2013). The facts and legal issues that we addressed then are similar to those
presented in this appeal, so we offer an abbreviated version of the background facts, focusing mainly on the analysis of
the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in the remand proceedings.
------------- Layer 85  ---------------
A
------------- Layer 86  ---------------
OWW filed the present action in 2004, charging Alps with infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,830,237 (“the ′237 patent”).
After the district court issued a claim construction order, Alps challenged the validity of the ′237 patent in two successive
ex parte reexamination proceedings before the Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). The district court stayed the
litigation pending the resolution of the reexamination proceedings.

Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South, LLC, 813 F.3d 1350 (2016)
118 U.S.P.Q.2d 1094
------------- Layer 90  ---------------
The  first  reexamination,  initiated  in  2006,  focused  on  advertisements  for  a  prior  art  cushioning  device  called  the
Silosheath, which was made by Silipos, Inc., one of OWW's competitors. The Silosheath consisted of a sheath made of
nylon fabric with gel material on the inner side. The examiner initially rejected all the challenged claims of the ′237
patent based on the Silosheath prior art. OWW overcame the rejection by showing the examiner a Silosheath product in
which the gel on the inner or skin side of the liner had bled through to the outer or prosthetic side. The examiner then
allowed OWW to amend its claims to clarify that the gel coating was found only on the inner side of its claimed device
and issued a reexamination certificate.
------------- Layer 91  ---------------
In 2008, shortly after the completion of the first reexamination, Alps initiated a second reexamination. The new request
for reexamination was based on an advertisement in a trade magazine published on January 1, 1995, which depicted a
gel liner identified as the Single Socket Gel Liner (“SSGL”), from Silipos's “Silosheath product line.” Alps argued that
the SSGL was invalidating prior art because it had gel on its inner surface, but not on its outer surface. The central issue
in the second reexamination was whether the synthetic fabric used in the SSGL prevented the gel on the skin side of the
liner from bleeding through to the prosthetic side.
------------- Layer 92  ---------------
In addition to the advertisement, Alps presented a declaration and deposition testimony from Jean–Paul Comtesse, who
worked at Silipos when the Silosheath and the SSGL were developed. Mr. Comtesse stated that the SSGL did not have
the same gel bleed-through problem as the Silosheath because it was manufactured from a fabric called “Coolmax” that
was thicker and denser than the fabric used in the Silosheath. Alps argued that, in light of the prior art evidence and Mr.
Comtesse's testimony, it was clear that the amended claims were invalid.
------------- Layer 93  ---------------
The examiner agreed with Alps and rejected the claims of the ′237 patent for obviousness in light of the SSGL and
other prior art. OWW appealed the rejection to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (“the Board”). In its
brief to the  *1354  Board, OWW argued that Mr. Comtesse's testimony was unreliable because it was uncorroborated
and because Mr. Comtesse was a highly interested witness. As to Mr. Comtesse's interest in the case, OWW argued
that he was the inventor of the SSGL and that he continued to receive royalties on that product. As to the absence of
corroboration, OWW argued that aside from Mr. Comtesse's testimony the only evidence relating to the SSGL was the
1995 advertisement, which contained no reference to Coolmax. According to OWW, there was “no other evidence of
any sort in this regard,” and because “the Comtesse testimony is not corroborated as required it cannot be properly used
to cure the very deficiencies in the [1995 advertisement] for which corroboration is lacking.”
------------- Layer 94  ---------------
In oral argument before the Board, OWW pressed its contention that there was no evidence corroborating Mr. Comtesse's
testimony about the SSGL. OWW also continued to argue that Mr. Comtesse was an interested witness, asserting that
he was an inventor of the SSGL and was still receiving royalties from Silipos's sales of that product.
------------- Layer 95  ---------------
The  Board  reversed  the  examiner's  rejection.  The  Board  agreed  with  OWW  that  Mr.  Comtesse's  testimony  was
uncorroborated and that he was an interested third party. Based on those conclusions, the Board held that the examiner
had erred in crediting Mr. Comtesse's testimony that the SSGL was made of Coolmax and had gel on only its inner side.
------------- Layer 96  ---------------
B
------------- Layer 97  ---------------
Following the second reexamination, the district court lifted the stay of the litigation. The court then granted Alps's
motion for summary judgment of invalidity as to all the asserted claims of the ′237 patent. The court invalidated some
of the claims based on the collateral estoppel effect of a decision against OWW in a case from a different district court.
It invalidated the remaining claims for obviousness based on the Silosheath, the SSGL, and other prior art references.
The court also addressed Alps's inequitable conduct claim, which was predicated on OWW's conduct before the PTO
during the two reexamination proceedings. As to that claim, the court granted summary judgment to OWW, holding
that there was no triable issue of inequitable conduct on OWW's part.

------------- Layer 102  ---------------
Both  sides  appealed.  This  court  affirmed  the  summary  judgment  of  invalidity.  With  respect  to  inequitable  conduct,
however, we concluded that the case presented genuine issues of material fact. Accordingly, we reversed the summary
judgment of no inequitable conduct and remanded the case to the district court for trial. Ohio Willow Wood Co., 735
F.3d 1333.
------------- Layer 103  ---------------
We noted that “OWW was only able to obtain issuance of the ′237 patent in the reexamination proceedings by arguing
that the prior art lacked gel liners with no observable gel material on their exterior surfaces.” Id. at 1345. In the second
reexamination, we added, “OWW was only able to overcome the examiner's final rejection in view of the SSGL by
convincing the [Board] that Mr. Comtesse was a highly interested witness and there was no evidence, as required by law,
to corroborate his testimony that the SSGL was constructed using a Coolmax fabric.” Id. at 1346.
------------- Layer 104  ---------------
As  to  corroboration,  we  stated  that  the  evidence  as  a  whole  provided  “consistent  and  convincing  evidence  that
corroborates Mr. Comtesse's testimony regarding the structure of the SSGL prior to [the ′  *1355  237 patent's critical
date of] March 5, 1995.” Id. at 1349.
------------- Layer 105  ---------------
As to whether Mr. Comtesse was an interested witness, we agreed with the district court that OWW had misrepresented
Mr. Comtesse's testimony to the Board. We stated that Mr. Comtesse “never admitted that he was interested in the
outcome of the present dispute nor did he ever admit that he was receiving royalty payments at the time of his deposition
in 2006.” 1  Id. at 1349.
------------- Layer 106  ---------------
Finally, with respect to the issue of intent, we stated that “OWW withheld various pieces of material information and
had no reasonable explanation for the several misrepresentations it made to the PTO.” Id. at 1351. The collective weight
of the evidence, we concluded, “would support a finding of intent that is the single most reasonable inference to be drawn
from the evidence at this stage of the proceedings.” Id.

------------- Layer 108  ---------------
On remand, the district court held a three-day bench trial on the inequitable conduct issue. Following the trial, the court
issued a lengthy opinion finding inequitable conduct in the second reexamination, but not in the first. The inequitable
conduct in the second reexamination, the court found, arose from the conduct of James Colvin, OWW's Director of
Research and Development, who was responsible for overseeing the Alps litigation for the company.
------------- Layer 109  ---------------
OWW used the same law firm for both the litigation and reexamination proceedings in this case. The firm established an
ethical screen to separate the attorney handling OWW's reexamination proceedings from the attorneys handling OWW's
litigation matters. With the creation of the screen, Mr. Colvin became the connection between OWW's litigation and
reexamination counsel. The district court found that, with occasional exceptions, Mr. Colvin was the ultimate decision
maker with respect to some of OWW's patent litigation matters, including this case. The court also found that Mr. Colvin
had reviewed filings and attended hearings in both the litigation and the reexamination proceedings, and that Mr. Colvin
was sophisticated with respect to patents and patent prosecution, as he had overseen the prosecution of about 30 patents
and was an inventor on about 20 patents. Mr. Colvin testified that, although he understood that he was the person “in
the middle,” he did not send OWW's reexamination counsel “all information ... regardless of how important it might
have been.” Instead, Mr. Colvin explained that he sent OWW's reexamination counsel only “whatever he requested or
I thought was appropriate.”

Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South, LLC, 813 F.3d 1350 (2016)
118 U.S.P.Q.2d 1094
------------- Layer 113  ---------------
The district court ruled that Mr. Colvin engaged in inequitable conduct during the second reexamination of the ′237
patent  based  on  a  series  of  factual  findings  regarding  whether  Mr.  Comtesse's  testimony  was  uncorroborated.  The
court found (1) that Mr. Colvin was aware that OWW's reexamination counsel had represented to the Board that Mr.
Comtesse's testimony was entirely uncorroborated; (2) that Mr. Colvin was aware of materials that corroborated Mr.
Comtesse's testimony; and (3) that Mr. Colvin failed to correct his counsel's misrepresentations.
------------- Layer 114  ---------------
The items the court identified as corroborative of Mr. Comtesse's testimony included a pair of letters sent to OWW in
April and October of 1999 by Michael Scalise, an attorney for Silipos (“the Scalise letters”). The first of the Scalise letters
stated that Silipos had sold the “SiloSheath  *1356  product line” since “at least as early as 1992” and that one of the
products in that line “contained the polymeric gel on only the inside of the sock.” That letter concluded that Silipos's
“original sales of their SiloSheath tube-shaped sock product line having the gelatinous materials on only the inside of
the sock pre-date the filing date” of the ′237 patent. The letter also enclosed a 1994 patent application amendment for
the Silosheath product line that disclosed a protective garment having “an inner layer comprising a gel.”
------------- Layer 115  ---------------
The second Scalise letter claimed that Silipos's sale of liners “having the gelatinous material on only the inside of the
sock pre-date the filing date of [the application that became the ′237 patent] by more than one year.” Attached to the
letter was a November 1, 1993, shipping invoice that the letter claimed was for one of the Silipos products with gel on
only one side.
------------- Layer 116  ---------------
OWW did not disclose the Scalise letters to its reexamination counsel, and the letters were not disclosed to the PTO in
the course of either reexamination. The district court found that Mr. Colvin was aware of the Scalise letters and that
the letters were corroborative of Mr. Comtesse's testimony. For that reason, the court ruled, the letters became material
when OWW contended that Mr. Comtesse's testimony was uncorroborated.
------------- Layer 117  ---------------
The district court also found that Mr. Colvin had knowledge of three declarations that were attached to Alps's 2006
summary  judgment  motion  in  the  district  court  litigation.  The  declarants  stated  that  Silipos  had  offered  the  SSGL
product prior to January 1, 1995, and that the SSGL had no gel on the exterior of the liner and no bleed-through, as
was the case with some of the Silo-sheath products. One of the three declarants stated that he had fitted a patient with
the SSGL, which used a substantially thicker fabric than the Silosheath, and as a result did not allow the gel to pass
through to the exterior of the liner.
------------- Layer 118  ---------------
The  court  found  that  the  Board  accepted  as  true  OWW's  representation  that  Mr.  Comtesse's  testimony  was
uncorroborated. The court further concluded that “absent OWW's misrepresentations that no corroborating evidence
existed, the [Board] would not have reversed the Examiner and reinstated the ′237 patent.” The court's finding mirrored
the Board's opinion that “the dispositive issue in this appeal is ... [the] testimony of [Mr. Comtesse] in support of the
rejections.”
------------- Layer 119  ---------------
Moving to the issue of intent, the district court found that the evidence was sufficient to infer deceptive intent on the
part of Mr. Colvin and OWW's reexamination counsel. While the court was not persuaded that deceptive intent was
the single most reasonable inference to draw from the evidence with respect to reexamination counsel, it reached the
opposite conclusion with respect to Mr. Colvin.
------------- Layer 120  ---------------
The  court  found  that  Mr.  Colvin  was  deeply  involved  in  both  the  reexamination  proceedings  and  the  infringement
litigation, and that he knew about various items bearing on the inequitable conduct allegations. The court therefore
found that Mr. Colvin was in a position to correct the misrepresentations regarding the evidence corroborating Mr.
Comtesse's testimony, but did not do so. In particular, the court found that Mr. Colvin was aware of the Scalise letters
and the 2006 declarations. The court rejected as not credible Mr. Colvin's testimony that he had never seen the 2006
declarations because he was barred from seeing them by the protective order entered in the district court case.

118 U.S.P.Q.2d 1094
------------- Layer 124  ---------------
As to the Scalise letters and the Silipos patent application referred to and attached to one of the letters, the district
court noted that Mr. Colvin “had no explanation for his failure to present those documents  *1357  to either [OWW's
prosecution  counsel]  or  the  PTO.”  The  court  therefore  held  that  “the  most  reasonable  inference  to  be  drawn  from
the evidence is that OWW acted with deceptive intent in misrepresenting the existence of evidence corroborating the
Comtesse testimony.” 2
------------- Layer 125  ---------------
Based on its inequitable conduct finding, the district court held the ′237 patent unenforceable, found the case to be
exceptional, and imposed a fee award against OWW. The fee award required OWW to pay Alps's attorneys' fees incurred
in litigating this case after September 30, 2011, the date of the Board's decision on the second reexamination.
------------- Layer 126  ---------------
Alps also requested that the district court extend its holding that the ′ 237 patent was unenforceable to three other
related patents owned by OWW, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,964,688, 7,291,182, and 8,523,951. The court denied that request.
It noted that Alps had not requested that relief in its counterclaim and that “Alps' arguments regarding the similarity of
the [three related OWW patents] go beyond the scope of evidence presented in this case.”
------------- Layer 127  ---------------
OWW argues that the district court erred in finding that OWW, through Mr. Colvin, was guilty of inequitable conduct
during the second reexamination.

 To prove the element of materiality, a party claiming inequitable conduct ordinarily must show that the patentee
“withheld  or  misrepresented  information  that,  in  the  absence  of  the  withholding  or  misrepresentation,  would  have
prevented a patent claim from issuing.” Ohio Willow Wood, 735 F.3d at 1345; Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291.

 The district court acknowledged that the Scalise letters did not “conclusively answer” the questions whether the
SSGL was on sale before the critical date of the ′237 patent and whether the SSGL had gel only on the inside of the
liner. However, the court explained that the significance of that evidence was not that it conclusively proved that an
anticipating device was on sale before that date, but that it corroborated Mr. Comtesse's testimony to that effect.
------------- Layer 135  ---------------
Mr. Comtesse testified that the SSGL depicted in the January 1, 1995 advertisement represented invalidating prior art
*1358  having gel only on the inner side. The assertion in the Scalise letters that Silipos sold a product “with gelatinous
material on only one side” prior to March 5, 1995, corroborates Mr. Comtesse's testimony. 3
------------- Layer 136  ---------------
The  district  court  found  that  the  withheld  evidence  became  “but-for”  material  to  patentability  in  the  second
reexamination once OWW argued to the Board that Mr. Comtesse's testimony was uncorroborated. That finding is well

supported in light of the Board's focus on the existence of corroborating evidence as the dispositive issue in the case and
its acceptance of OWW's representations that no corroborating evidence existed.
------------- Layer 141  ---------------
OWW argues that the Scalise letters were not material because they referred to the Silosheath, not the SSGL. In fact,
however, the letters used the term “Silosheath” not to refer to a single product, but to refer to a line of products (“the
Silosheath product line”), which included one product containing gel on only one side. The use of the term “Silosheath
product line” to include the SSGL is reflected in January 1, 1995, advertisement, which refers to the SSGL in connection
with the “Silosheath product line.”
------------- Layer 142  ---------------
OWW also argues that Silipos used the term Silo-sheath to refer to products with a thin nylon sheath, not the thicker
fabric found in the SSGL, which was referred to as a “liner.” Again, the Scalise letters undermine that argument; the
second  Scalise  letter  refers  to  “various  Silosheath  tube-shaped  sock  products,”  including  the  “Silosheath  Prosthetic
Liner,” sold before the critical date of the ′237 patent, which had “gelatinous material on only the inside of the sock.”
------------- Layer 143  ---------------
The district court's finding on the issue of materiality is supported by the evidence at the trial on remand. Given the
Board's determination that corroboration was the dispositive issue, and in light of OWW's assertions before the PTO
that  there  was  no  corroborating  evidence  for  Mr.  Comtesse's  testimony,  the  district  court's  determination  that  the
corroborating evidence was material to patentability is not clearly erroneous.

 Specific intent to commit acts constituting inequitable conduct may be inferred from indirect and circumstantial
evidence. Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1290. But deceptive intent must be “the single most reasonable inference drawn from
the evidence.” Id.

 As to the evidence corroborating Mr. Comtesse's testimony, the court found that Mr. Colvin was aware of the 1999
Scalise letters and knew that their contents were consistent with Mr. Comtesse's testimony. For that reason, the court
found that Mr. Colvin knew that evidence corroborating Mr. Comtesse was in OWW's possession. The court further
found that Mr. Colvin understood from his counsel and from his experience before the PTO that he had a duty of
candor separate and apart from his attorney's duty; 4  that  *1359  he had the opportunity to correct the representations
that  OWW  made  to  the  Board  regarding  Mr.  Comtesse's  testimony;  and  that  he  took  no  action  to  correct  those
misrepresentations. Based on those subsidiary findings, the district court found that deceptive intent was demonstrated
by clear and convincing evidence.
------------- Layer 147  ---------------
The evidence supports the district court's finding that Mr. Colvin's act of withholding the letters was the product of
deceptive intent. It is clear from Mr. Colvin's testimony that he understood that the appeal to the Board in the second
reexamination turned in substantial part on the question of corroboration. Mr. Colvin's testimony also reflects that he
understood that he could have given his reexamination counsel the Scalise letters at any point but that he chose not
to do so.
------------- Layer 148  ---------------
The court found that OWW offered no reasonable explanation for Mr. Colvin's conduct. Although Mr. Colvin knew
that he was responsible for providing information in OWW's possession to his reexamination counsel, the court noted
that Mr. Colvin had “no explanation for his failure to present [the letters]” to his reexamination counsel or the PTO.
The court concluded that the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was that Mr. Colvin had acted
with deceptive intent.
------------- Layer 149  ---------------
OWW suggests that Mr. Colvin did not correct the misrepresentation because he believed the Scalise letters were not
prior art. The district court, however, reasonably found that OWW's explanation was not a valid excuse for his conduct.

The record reflects that Mr. Colvin understood that corroboration and prior art were separate questions in the appeal. If
Mr. Colvin had understood those questions to be the same, his belief as to what constituted prior art might be relevant.
However, given his understanding that the issues were distinct, his opinion regarding whether the letters constituted prior
art does not provide an explanation for his failure to disclose the letters as corroborative evidence. The district court's
determination that deceptive intent was the most reasonable inference for Colvin's conduct is not clearly erroneous.

 In addition to the Scalise letters, the district court held that Mr. Colvin was guilty of inequitable conduct in the
second reexamination by withholding the 2006 declarations from the PTO. OWW argues that Mr. Colvin was unaware
of those declarations because they were contained in a summary judgment motion in the district court litigation that was
filed under seal and was subject to a protective order. Mr. Colvin testified that he believed he was not entitled to read
the sealed materials and therefore did not read the summary judgment motion or the attached declarations.
------------- Layer 156  ---------------
The district court found Mr. Colvin's testimony on that point not to be credible, as the protective order did not bar
OWW employees such as Mr. Colvin from viewing sealed materials (other than those denominated for attorneys' eyes
only). The court found that it was “inconceivable that the OWW representative responsible for litigation involving the
′237 patent—the commercial embodiment of which ... was OWW's best-selling product—would not review the portions
of Alps's summary judgment motion and exhibits not designated as ‘attorney's eyes only,’ ” or otherwise designated as
confidential. The court therefore found that as of 2006 Mr. Colvin knew that the three prosthetists, who had no apparent
connection to Mr. Comtesse, “had corroborated his testimony that Silipos manufactured and sold a version of the SSGL
that did not allow gel bleed-through prior to March 5, 1995.”
------------- Layer 157  ---------------
Viewing the record as a whole, we disagree with the district court that there was  *1360  clear and convincing evidence
that Mr. Colvin was aware of the 2006 declarations. No witness testified that Mr. Colvin saw the 2006 declarations or
learned of their contents. Mr. Colvin testified that he believed he had never seen the declarations and was only told about
the basis for the summary judgment motion “in general terms.” He testified that he was told only that “there were some
declarations that supported the [summary judgment] motion and that it was filed under seal.”
------------- Layer 158  ---------------
Both  of  the  litigation  attorneys  for  OWW  testified  that  they  understood  that  the  entire  appendix  of  the  summary
judgment motion, which included the declarations, was confidential and could not be shared with Mr. Colvin. Moreover,
one of the litigation attorneys testified that the appendix to the summary judgment motion consisted of a single bound
volume, and that he had never separated the materials specifically marked as confidential from other materials in that
volume.
------------- Layer 159  ---------------
In light of the high standard of proof required to establish the intent prong of inequitable conduct, we conclude that the
evidence of Mr. Colvin's role in supervising the litigation was not sufficient under the circumstances to establish that he
was familiar with the 2006 declarations, even in light of the district court's credibility judgment regarding Mr. Colvin.
In analogous situations, this court has held circumstantial evidence of the sort at issue in this case to be insufficient
to meet the “clear and convincing evidence” standard for inequitable conduct, even when the district court has made
credibility findings against the party charged with inequitable conduct. See 1st Media, LLC v. Elec. Arts, Inc., 694 F.3d
1367 (Fed.Cir.2012); Star Sci., Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 537 F.3d 1357 (Fed.Cir.2008). Based on the failure
of proof, we hold that Alps failed to show that Mr. Colvin acted with deceptive intent in concealing those declarations
from the PTO or that deceptive intent was the single most reasonable inference to draw from his conduct.
------------- Layer 160  ---------------
In sum, we uphold the district court's findings regarding Mr. Colvin's failure to call the Scalise letters to the PTO's
attention in the second reexamination. Based on those findings, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion
in determining that Mr. Colvin was guilty of inequitable conduct in the second reexamination.

  In  its  cross-appeal,  Alps  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  by  finding  no  inequitable  conduct  during  the  first
reexamination. 5  Alps contends that the district court's conclusion with respect to the first reexamination conflicts with
its conclusion regarding the second reexamination. We disagree. The court's ruling regarding the second reexamination
centered on Mr. Colvin's failure to correct OWW's misrepresentations to the Board concerning the purported absence
of corroborating evidence  *1361  for Mr. Comtesse's testimony. No such misrepresentations were made during the first
reexamination.
------------- Layer 167  ---------------
The district court concluded that Alps failed to show that any of the items that it complained were not provided to the
PTO in the course of the first reexamination were “but-for” material to that reexamination. The court found that the
Comtesse testimony was before the examiner in the first reexamination and that items that corroborated Mr. Comtesse's
testimony were not material to the first reexamination. After analyzing Alps's claims as to each item that it contends
should have been disclosed to the examiner, the court concluded that “OWW did not withhold or misrepresent ‘but-for’
material information during the first reexamination proceedings.” We hold that those findings are not clearly erroneous,
and we therefore reject Alps's contention that the court's differing conclusions with respect to the two reexaminations
cannot stand.

 Alps also appeals from the district court's decision not to extend the determination of unenforceability beyond the
′237 patent to at least two of the related OWW patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,964,688 and 7,291,182. The district court
did not err in that regard. As the district court noted, those patents have never been at issue in this litigation, and Alps
did not request in its counterclaim the sweeping relief that it now asks us to direct the district court to grant. Moreover,
because different evidence may be pertinent to a claim of inequitable conduct directed to those other patents, the district
court properly ruled that the findings that would be necessary to hold those patents unenforceable would go “beyond
the scope of evidence presented in this case.” The district court's refusal to extend the unenforceability holding in these
circumstances is appropriately within its discretion and is not in error.
------------- Layer 170  ---------------
We  therefore  affirm  the  district  court's  decision  that  the  ′237  patent  is  unenforceable  for  inequitable  conduct  in
connection  with  the  second  reexamination,  but  not  in  connection  with  the  first.  We  also  affirm  the  district  court's
decisions with respect to the appropriate remedy.

OWW's reexamination counsel has since admitted that his statement regarding the payment of royalties to Mr. Comtesse was
incorrect.
The court credited Mr. Colvin's statement that he was unaware that Mr. Comtesse had testified that he was not currently
receiving royalties for the SSGL. Accordingly, the court found that the evidence did not show that Mr. Colvin knew that his
reexamination counsel's statements to the Board about Mr. Comtesse's royalties were false. For that reason, the court held
that Mr. Colvin did not commit inequitable conduct in misrepresenting the issue of royalties to the PTO.
In addition to the substance of the assertions contained in the Scalise letters, the fact that they were sent approximately five
years before the litigation commenced and more than seven years before Mr. Comtesse was deposed is significant, as the letters
would have undercut OWW's contention that Mr. Comtesse's testimony about the SSGL was influenced by the litigation and
was unreliable because of the years that had passed since the events in question.
The PTO imposes a duty of candor on “the patent owner, each attorney or agent who represents the patent owner, and every
other individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding.” 37 C.F.R. §
1.555(a); see also 37 C.F.R. § 1.56 (imposing a duty of candor in dealings with the PTO).
OWW argues that Alps's challenge to the district court's ruling on the first reexamination is not a proper subject for a cross-
appeal because its argument, if successful, would merely provide an alternative ground for affirmance of the judgment of
unenforceability. We disagree. A cross-appeal is the proper way to proceed if the cross-appellant is seeking to lessen the rights
of its adversary or enlarge its own rights. See El Paso Nat. Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473, 479, 119 S.Ct. 1430, 143 L.Ed.2d
635 (1999); Bailey v. Dart Container Corp., 292 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002). A judgment of unenforceability based on
both the first and second reexaminations would expose OWW to a larger attorney fee award than a judgment based on the
second reexamination alone. It was therefore proper for Alps to press its argument as to the first reexamination by way of
a cross-appeal.
