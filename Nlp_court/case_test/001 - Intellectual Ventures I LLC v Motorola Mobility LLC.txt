Synopsis
Background: Owner and licensee sued for infringement of patent for a file transfer system that enabled direct transfer
of electronic files between interconnected personal computers and a patent for a laptop computer formed by docking a
smartphone into a shell having a larger display and keyboard. Following a jury trial, the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware, no. 1:11-cv-00908-SLR-MPT, Sue L. Robinson, J., 176 F.Supp.3d 405, entered judgment
of infringement and denied alleged infringer's motion for judgment as a matter of law. Alleged infringer appealed.

Whether a patent claim is adequately supported by the written description is a question of fact that the Court
of Appeals reviews for substantial evidence following a jury trial; however, to the extent that the issue of the
written description requirement turns on claim construction based solely on intrinsic evidence is a legal question
subject to de novo review. 35 U.S.C.A. § 112.

Patents
Patent for a file transfer system that enabled direct transfer of electronic files between interconnected personal
computers without intermediate storage of files on an intervening computer excluded long-term or permanent
storage of files; while the words “long-term” and “permanent” did not appear in the patent, the specification's
explanation that the file transfer method did not use intermediate storage necessarily excluded long-term and
permanent storage.

Substantial evidence supported jury's determination that a patent for a file transfer system that enabled direct
transfer of electronic files between interconnected personal computers without intermediate storage of files on
an intervening computer was not obvious in light of prior patents for a system for text communications between
a plurality of terminals and for simultaneous electronic transactions with visible trusted parties, where there was
expert testimony that the first prior patent's receive mode, which allowed a user to receive files without having
to log on or download files, was not the equivalent of receiving files irrespective of user action, as required by
the challenged patent claims.

Substantial evidence supported jury's determination there was no motivation to combine prior patents for a
computer in which a portable and desktop environment provided for a common processor and memory module
and for a portable computer having an interface for direct connection to a mobile telephone, and thus a patent
for a laptop computer formed by docking a smartphone into a shell having a larger display and keyboard was
not obvious in light of the prior patents, where one of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated
to modify the second prior patent's portable telephone to control the first prior patent's base unit, as such a
combination would require duplicating resources and result in an combination that was suboptimal.

Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Intellectual Ventures II LLC (collectively “IV”) brought suit against Motorola Mobility
LLC (“Motorola”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of claim 41
of U.S. Patent No. 7,810,144 (“the '144 patent”) and claims 1, 10, 11, and 13 of U.S. Patent No. 7,120,462 (“the '462
patent”). A jury found the asserted claims infringed and not invalid. The district court denied Motorola's motion for
judgment as a matter of law. Motorola appeals.
------------- Layer 82  ---------------
We hold that substantial evidence supports the jury's verdict regarding the validity of claim 41 of the '144 patent and
claims 1, 10, 11, and 13 of the '462 patent, but conclude that substantial evidence does not support the jury's verdict of
direct infringement of claim 41 of the '144 patent. Since a finding of direct infringement is a predicate to any finding
of indirect infringement, we reverse all of the infringement findings with respect to the '144 patent. We therefore affirm
the district court's judgment in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings on the asserted claims of the
'462 patent.

IV filed suit for infringement of the '144 and '462 patents in the District of Delaware. Motorola defended on the grounds
of no infringement and invalidity. The district court bifurcated the determination of willful infringement and calculation
of damages for separate trial. See Scheduling Order, Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility LLC, No. 1:11–
cv-00908–SLR-MPT (D. Del. Jan. 13, 2012), ECF No. 16.
------------- Layer 123  ---------------
The district court conducted a first jury trial with respect to claims 1, 8, 10, 11, and 13 of the '462 patent that ended in
a mistrial. See Intellectual Ventures I, LLC v. Motorola Mobility LLC, 72 F.Supp.3d 496, 501 (D. Del. 2014). Post-trial,
the court denied Motorola's motion for judgment as a matter of law that the asserted claims were invalid as obvious.
See id. at 513.
------------- Layer 124  ---------------
The district court conducted a second trial, this time regarding infringement and validity of claim 41 of the '144 patent.
A jury found that Motorola had directly and indirectly infringed claim 41 and had failed to prove obviousness of the
asserted claim. The jury also found that Motorola had failed to prove claim 41 invalid for lack of written description.
------------- Layer 125  ---------------
The parties retried infringement and validity of the '462 patent in yet a third trial, this time with respect to claims 1, 10,
11, and 13. The jury found that Motorola had infringed the asserted claims and that Motorola had failed to prove the
asserted claims invalid as obvious.
------------- Layer 126  ---------------
Motorola  moved  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  in  both  the  second  and  third  trials,  challenging  the  jury  verdicts
of infringement and no invalidity. The district court denied Motorola's motions. See Intellectual Ventures I, LLC v.
Motorola Mobility LLC, 176 F.Supp.3d 405, 444 (D. Del. 2016). Motorola appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.

DISCUSSION
------------- Layer 128  ---------------
We  review  the  district  court's  denial  of  a  motion  for  judgment  as  matter  of  law  de  novo.  See  Finjan,  Inc.  v.  Secure
Computing Corp., 626 F.3d 1197, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing McKenna v. City of Philadelphia, 582 F.3d 447, 460 (3d
Cir. 2009)).
------------- Layer 129  ---------------
I
------------- Layer 130  ---------------
[1] Motorola argues that the district court erred in denying judgment as a matter of law that claim 41 of the '144 patent is
invalid for lack of written description. Whether a patent claim is adequately supported by the written description under
35 U.S.C. § 112 is a question of fact that we review for substantial evidence following a  *1325  jury trial. See, e.g., Ariad
Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (en banc). To the extent that the issue of written
description turns on claim construction based solely on intrinsic evidence, however, it is a legal question subject to de
novo review. See, e.g., Atl. Research Mktg. Sys., Inc. v. Troy, 659 F.3d 1345, 1353–54 (Fed. Cir. 2011).
------------- Layer 131  ---------------
[2] Motorola contends that the specification of the '144 patent excludes “long-term” or “permanent” storage of the data
being transmitted on an intervening computing device. Despite this exclusion, Motorola argues that the scope of claim
41 covers embodiments that nevertheless use such long-term or permanent storage, in violation of the written description
requirement.

------------- Layer 134  ---------------
Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility LLC, 870 F.3d 1320 (2017)
124 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
------------- Layer 135  ---------------
The words “long-term” and “permanent” do not appear in the '144 patent. Instead, the specification of the '144 patent
describes that “electronic transfer mechanisms” over “interconnected networks of computers and telecommunications
equipment ... generally employ intermediary computers in the form of e-mail servers, FTP servers, or Web servers.”
'144 patent, col. 2 l. 31–col. 3 l. 4. The specification further explains that “[t]hese intermediary computers” come with
several drawbacks because they: (1) “reduce the relative security and timeliness of the transfers effected because neither
the sender nor the recipient controls the intermediary server”; (2) “require significant administration and usually require
login procedures and passwords in an attempt to overcome security issues, albeit at the expense of user convenience and
system complexity”; and (3) “represent concentrated points of possible failure, as well as communication ‘bottlenecks'
that set capacity limits for the collective number and size of files transferred.” Id. col. 3 ll. 4–15.
------------- Layer 136  ---------------
To overcome these drawbacks, the invention of the '144 patent is a “file transfer system” that “enables direct transfer
of electronic files between ... interconnected [personal computers] ... and without intermediate storage of files on an
intervening computer.” '144 patent, col. 10 l. 63–col. 11 l. 1. Motorola principally relies on this portion of the specification
to argue that the invention of the '144 patent does not employ “long-term” or “permanent storage” because it excludes
intermediate storage, and that, consequently, claim 41 lacks written description support because the claim nonetheless
covers embodiments that use long-term or permanent storage.
------------- Layer 137  ---------------
While there is some dispute as to whether Motorola preserved this precise issue for appellate review, we agree with the
district court that under the proper claim construction, “claim 41 does not cover file transfers that involve long-term or
permanent storage.” Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at 426. The relevant limitations of claim 41 recite “send[ing]
the single combined file to the second device” and “receiv[ing] the single combined file ... at the second device.” '144
patent, col. 45 ll. 17–22. This language neither plainly includes nor plainly excludes long-term or permanent storage. The
limitations must be construed “in view of the specification.” Trustees of Columbia Univ. v. Symantec Corp., 811 F.3d 1359,
1362 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc)). The portions of
the specification that Motorola relies on, excerpted above, demonstrate that storing files “indefinitely” on an intervening
computer is not part of the claimed invention. Paradoxically, Motorola contends that these portions of the specification
exclude long-term or permanent storage from the scope of the invention, while simultaneously arguing that claim 41
should be read to cover such storage. The proper result is not that claim 41 fails for lack of written description but that
it should be construed “in view of the specification”  *1326  to be limited. Id. at 1362; C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Systems,
Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“[I]t is incorrect to construe the claims contrary to the specification, and
then to hold the claims invalid because they are contrary to the specification.”). Thus, the “send[ing]” and “receiv[ing]”
limitations of claim 41 should be construed to exclude long-term or permanent storage.
------------- Layer 138  ---------------
Motorola argues that other claims of the '144 patent recite limitations regarding storage of the file being transferred,
which—according  to  Motorola—suggests  that  claim  41's  silence  broadens  the  claim  to  cover  all  forms  of  storage,
including  long-term  or  permanent  storage.  Claim  26,  for  example,  recites  “transmit[ting]  the  selected  file  ...  absent
non-transient intermediate storage of the selected file on an intervening communications device of the communications
network, to the second device.” '144 patent, col. 41 l. 66–col. 42 l. 2 (emphasis added). We do not agree. The fact that
other claims expressly limit the type of storage does not mean that claim 41 extends to long-term or permanent storage.
We also disagree with Motorola that the doctrine of claim differentiation militates in Motorola's favor, because that
“doctrine ... does not serve to broaden claims beyond their meaning in light of the specification.” Toro Co. v. White
Consol. Indus., Inc., 199 F.3d 1295, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 1999). 1
------------- Layer 139  ---------------
Since the asserted claim does not cover long-term or permanent storage, the failure of the specification to describe such
an embodiment presents no written description problem. The district court did not err in denying Motorola's motion for
judgment as a matter of law for lack of written description as to claim 41 of the '144 patent.

------------- Layer 144  ---------------
[3] Motorola next argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law that claim 41 of the '144 patent is invalid
as obvious over the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 5,379,340 (“Overend”) and U.S. Patent No. 5,553,145 (“Micali”). The
ultimate determination of obviousness presents a legal question subject to de novo review, but “explicit and implicit”
subsidiary factual determinations made by the jury—including the scope and content of the prior art—are reviewed for
substantial evidence. See, e.g., Kinetic Concepts, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 688 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
------------- Layer 145  ---------------
[4] Claim 41 recites, inter alia, a “second device ... configured to ... receive the single combined file irrespective of user
action at the second device.” '144 patent, col. 45 ll. 20–21. Before the jury, Motorola argued that claim 41 would have
been obvious over a combination of Overend and Micali. Motorola's obviousness case depended in part on its argument
that the “irrespective of user action” limitation was taught by Overend's disclosure of a “secure file transfer interface
program” having a “Receive Mode” capable of receiving files “without any intervention by [the user].” Overend col. 20
ll. 67–68. The parties did not seek a construction of the “irrespective of user action” limitation from the district court,
and neither party objected to the district court's instruction to the jury that the limitation was to be   *1327  given its
“ordinary meaning.” Final Jury Instructions 20, Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility LLC, No. 1:11–cv–
00908–SLR–MPT (D. Del. Mar. 24, 2015), ECF No. 407.
------------- Layer 146  ---------------
In this situation, the dispositive question on appeal is “whether substantial evidence supported the verdict under the
agreed instruction.” Hewlett–Packard Co. v. Mustek Sys., Inc., 340 F.3d 1314, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also id. at 1321
(“The verdict must be tested by the charge actually given and by giving the ordinary meaning of the language of the jury
instruction.”). The district court denied judgement as a matter of law on this question, stating that “[t]he ‘Receive’ mode
disclosed in Overend and the ‘irrespective of user action’ limitation are not the same because Overend specifies that the
device be unattended in ‘Receive’ mode.” 176 F.Supp.3d at 427. Based on our review of the trial record, we conclude
that there was substantial evidence for the jury to find that Overend's “Receive Mode” did not satisfy the “irrespective
of user action” limitation of claim 41.
------------- Layer 147  ---------------
To be sure, Motorola's expert testified that the “Receive Mode” of Overend's software allowed a user to receive files
without having to “log in” or “download” files. See J.A. 739 (“The basic idea here in the Overend patent is, you turn
on the machine .... You walk away and it sits there and takes all the messages coming through it.”). But IV's expert
explained that this functionality of “Receive Mode” was not equivalent to receiving files “irrespective of user action”
because “[i]f you're in any other mode or doing any other thing on this machine, you cannot receive messages.” J.A.

So only if you're in ... receive mode ... will you be able to receive messages. If you select any of the
other menu options ... you will not be in receive mode. So, for example, [if] I want to send you a
message ... while I'm ty[p]ing that message in, I can't receive any messages. And so going back to
that irrespective of user action does not meet what's happening here in [Overend].
------------- Layer 149  ---------------
J.A. 827–28.
------------- Layer 150  ---------------
There  is  no  dispute  that  Overend's  software  must  be  in  “Receive  Mode”  to  receive  files  and  that  “Receive  Mode”
precludes a user from using the prior art software for other purposes. See Overend, col. 39 ll. 14–15 (“To be able to receive
documents, LIX must be in Receive Mode.”). Thus, faced with competing expert testimony on the question of whether
Overend's software satisfied the “irrespective of user action” limitation, “the jury was free to disbelieve [Motorola's]
expert and credit [IV's] expert.” i4i Ltd. P'ship v. Microsoft Corp., 598 F.3d 831, 850 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also Edwards

the facts for the jury's version”). The testimony of IV's expert and the teachings of Overend itself constituted substantial
evidence supporting the jury's conclusion that the prior art did not “receive ... files irrespective of user action.”
------------- Layer 155  ---------------
Thus, because substantial evidence supports the jury's verdict finding claim 41 of the '144 patent nonobvious, the district
court correctly denied Motorola judgment as a matter of law. 2

*1328  III
------------- Layer 157  ---------------
Having concluded that substantial evidence supports the jury's verdict of no invalidity with respect to claim 41 of the '144
patent, we turn to the question of whether there was substantial evidence of direct infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(a).
------------- Layer 158  ---------------
The parties have treated claim 41 as a system claim with limitations directed to a “communications device,” a “second
device,” and an “authenticating device configured to ... generate a delivery report.” At trial, IV argued that Motorola's
customers directly infringed claim 41 by using the accused system to send text-plus-photo messages using a Multimedia
Messaging Service (“MMS”), and that Motorola itself directly infringed claim 41 by testing the accused phones' MMS
functionality. See Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at 421–23. As evidence, IV presented consumer surveys showing
that  Motorola's  customers  sent  MMS  messages  using  the  accused  phones,  and  “numerous  compliance  and  testing
documents” from Motorola demonstrating “that sending and receiving of MMS messages was tested on the various
carrier networks.” Id. at 423. Under these theories, when accused Motorola phones were used to send and receive text-
plus-photo MMS messages, the devices met the limitations of the “communications device” and the “second device” of
the asserted claim.
------------- Layer 159  ---------------
Motorola does not dispute that the accused phones meet the limitations of the “communications device” and the “second
device.” Instead, Motorola contends that IV failed to offer evidence of a directly infringing “use” of the claimed system
because none of the accused direct infringers “used” the “authenticating device configured to ... generate a delivery
report.”
------------- Layer 160  ---------------
A
------------- Layer 161  ---------------
We first address the applicable standard under Centillion Data Systems, LLC v. Qwest Communications International,
Inc., 631 F.3d 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Claim 41 is written to claim a “device configured” to perform certain operations,
some of which involve communications with other devices having certain functionality. But the parties have treated
Centillion, which addressed claims to “systems comprising” certain elements, as the governing one in this case, and for
that reason we limit our consideration to what Centillion means for this case. We do not decide what standards would
govern here if claim 41 were not treated as a system claim under Centillion.
------------- Layer 162  ---------------
In NTP, Inc. v. Research in Motion, Ltd., in addressing the question of “where” an infringing use of a claimed system
occurs, we held that “[t]he use of a claimed system under section 271(a) is the place at which the system as a whole is
put into service, i.e., the place where control of the system is exercised and beneficial use of the system obtained.” 418
F.3d 1282, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Subsequently, in Centillion, we applied NTP's situs-of-infringement holding to resolve
infringement of “system comprising” claims where components of the claimed system were “in the possession of more
than one actor.” 631 F.3d at 1283. We concluded that “to ‘use’ a system for purposes of infringement, a party must put
the invention into service, i.e., control the system as a whole and obtain benefit from it.” Id. at 1284. Thus, under NTP
and Centillion, to prove an infringing “use” of a system under § 271(a), a patentee must demonstrate “use”—that is,
“control” and “benefit”—of the claimed system by an accused direct infringer.

124 U.S.P.Q.2d 1129
------------- Layer 166  ---------------
*1329  The district court held (and IV argues on appeal) that Centillion requires only that the infringer benefit from the
“system as a whole,” such that a benefit derived from any claimed component of the claimed system would suffice to
demonstrate an infringing “use.” The district court concluded: “Centillion did not hold that the infringer [must] ‘benefit’
from every single limitation. Rather Centillion held that the user must ‘obtain benefit’ from the ‘system as a whole’ and
its analysis of ... benefit was not on a limitation-by-limitation basis.” Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at 422.
------------- Layer 167  ---------------
We disagree. Centillion and NTP held that to “use” something is to put it into service, which means to control and benefit
from it. And Centillion explicitly added that, to use a claimed system, what must be “used” is each element. Centillion,
631 F.3d at 1284 (“We agree that direct infringement by ‘use’ of a system claim ‘requires a party ... to use each and
every ... element of a claim [system].’ In order to ‘put the system into service,’ the end user must be using all portions of
the claimed invention.” (alterations in original)). From those two propositions, it follows that, to use a system, a person
must control (even if indirectly) and benefit from each claimed component.
------------- Layer 168  ---------------
NTP and Centillion both found control of and benefit from every element on their particular facts. In NTP, customers
of the accused infringer, by exchanging messages over the allegedly infringing system, controlled and benefitted from the
claim-required relay equipment at issue, which was part of what made the message ex-changes work. See NTP, 418 F.3d
at 1317. In Centillion, the customers found to be direct infringers controlled and benefitted from back-end processing
equipment over which they exercised no physical control by requesting service and requesting particular reports, and
because their requests produced response from the back-end equipment on a “one request/one response basis.” Centillion,
631 F.3d at 1285–86.
------------- Layer 169  ---------------
  [6] We therefore reject IV's reading of Centillion. In an analysis of a system claim under Centillion, proof of an
------------- Layer 170  ---------------
[5]
infringing  “use”  of  the  claimed  system  under  §  271(a)  requires  the  patentee  to  demonstrate  that  the  direct  infringer
obtained “benefit” from each and every element of the claimed system. See Centillion, 631 F.3d at 1284. In addition, the
direct or indirect control required “is the ability to place the system as a whole into service.” Id.
------------- Layer 171  ---------------
B
------------- Layer 172  ---------------
[7] Under  Centillion,  the  critical  question  here  is  whether  there  was  substantial  evidence  that  Motorola's  customers
obtained a “benefit” from the generation of delivery reports. Neither of IV's direct infringement theories purported to
explain how Motorola's customers satisfied this claim limitation by using the accused phones. Indeed, there is no evidence
that the customers ever “generate[d] a delivery report.” Instead, IV relied on testimony and evidence that the delivery
reports were generated by Multimedia Messaging Service Centers (“MMSC”) maintained or operated by the customers'
wireless service carriers when the customers used the accused phones.
------------- Layer 173  ---------------
IV's main argument is that Centillion does not require that Motorola's customer benefit from the MMSCs' generation
of delivery reports. We have rejected that reading of Centillion. But IV also asserts, almost in passing, that Motorola's
customers directly benefitted from the delivery reports because “the user sending the MMS does benefit ... from the
MMSC authenticating the transfer with a delivery report noting the date and time when it is delivered.” Here, IV's sole
record citation  *1330  contains just one sentence about the delivery report, and that sentence says nothing about benefits
flowing from the delivery reports to the customer sending the message. See J.A. 618.
------------- Layer 174  ---------------
In the '144 patent, the only benefits identified as flowing from the delivery reports rest on the sending device's ability to
receive or retrieve the delivery reports from the third-party authenticating device. See, e.g., '144 patent, col. 6 ll. 38–41
(providing that “after authentication by the third party authenticator ... at least one file authentication is received from
the third party” (emphasis added)); id. col. 19 ll. 4–9 (“The receipt file is returned from the recipient to the sender directly
or through a third party ... The sender may designate whether confirmation is by direct return or through a third party ...

common to all users.” (emphasis added)). But the evidence does not support an inference that Motorola's customers
ever received the delivery reports.
------------- Layer 179  ---------------
IV provided expert testimony that the accused Motorola phones were capable of sending and receiving MMS messages,
and that the sending phone could display a confirmation that the MMS message was received. 3  IV's expert conceded,
however, that all but one of the MMSCs discussed at trial had been rendered technologically incapable of transmitting
delivery reports to the sending phone (i.e., to Motorola's customers). With respect to these MMSCs, the expert testified
that the delivery reports were generated and stored on the MMSCs themselves. But the mere fact that the reports were
stored on the MMSCs does not show that Motorola's customers could have received or, in fact, actually received delivery
reports. Thus, with respect to the MMSCs that were incapable of transmitting or otherwise providing delivery reports
to  the  sending  phone,  the  benefits  identified  by  the  '144  patent  from  receiving  a  delivery  report  never  materialized.
With respect to the final carrier (which could transmit delivery reports to the sending phone), IV's evidence further
demonstrated that by default, the accused Motorola phones were configured not to request delivery reports from the
MMSCs.  As  a  consequence,  unless  a  customer  affirmatively  took  steps  to  alter  the  default  configuration  of  his  or
her  phone,  the  benefit  of  confirming  receipt  could  not  have  been  realized.  Here,  IV  did  not  produce  evidence  that
any customers actually altered their phones to receive delivery reports. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record
demonstrating that customers even knew that the delivery reports existed or could be obtained. 4
------------- Layer 180  ---------------
In the record below and at oral argument in this court, IV's counsel asserted two additional theories for how Motorola's
customers  indirectly  benefitted  from  delivery  reports  generated  by  the  MMSCs.  First,  IV's  counsel  told  the  jury  in
opening argument that the delivery reports were used by the carriers to bill customers for sending MMS messages. See
J.A. 578 (“That device, the [authentication] device, validates the delivery of the messages and can be used for billing.”).
Second, IV's counsel told this court at oral argument that the delivery reports could be used as an antifraud measure.
See Oral Argument at 24:01, Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility LLC, No. 16–1795 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 7,
2017). But IV has not pointed to any trial evidence relying on either theory as a basis for inferring a customer benefit,
and the specification of the '144 patent provides no suggestion that the delivery  *1331  reports are used in these manners.
Thus, these theories of indirect benefit amount to mere speculation or attorney argument and do not provide substantial
evidence supporting the jury's verdict of direct infringement. Thus, judgment as a matter of law should have been granted
that Motorola's customers did not infringe claim 41.
------------- Layer 181  ---------------
C
------------- Layer 182  ---------------
IV's  brief  notably  does  not  address  the  patentee's  direct  infringement  theory  that  Motorola  itself—as  opposed  to
Motorola's customers—directly infringed claim 41 by testing the accused phones on various carrier networks. In fact,
both in this court and before the district court, IV has never identified any benefit flowing to Motorola above and beyond
that which would flow to its customers due to the manufacturer's testing. See Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at
423. Having rejected as unsupported by substantial evidence IV's argument that Motorola's customers benefitted from
the delivery reports generated by the MMSCs, the same non-infringement finding is necessary as to Motorola itself.
------------- Layer 183  ---------------
In sum, IV failed to present substantial evidence that the parties accused of direct infringement in this case benefitted
from the limitation of “generat [ing] a delivery report” of the claimed system. As such, IV failed to prove a directly
infringing “use” under § 271(a). And, because a finding of direct infringement is predicate to any finding of indirect
infringement, none of the jury's verdicts with respect to infringement of claim 41 of the '144 of the patent is supported
by substantial evidence. See Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Techs., Inc., ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S.Ct. 2111, 2117, 189
L.Ed.2d 52 (2014). Accordingly, Motorola was entitled to judgment as a matter of law regarding non-infringement of
claim 41 of the '144 patent.

------------- Layer 188  ---------------
[8] We finally address Motorola's argument that the district court erred in denying judgment as a matter of law with
respect to claims 1, 10, 11, and 13 of the '462 patent. Motorola contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of
law that the asserted claims were obvious over a combination of references, U.S. Patent No. 5,436,857 (“Nelson”) and
U.S. Patent No. 7,549,007 (“Smith”). 5
------------- Layer 189  ---------------
The asserted claims of the '462 patent are directed to a “portable processing device” comprising a “detachable handset
unit” and a “portable docking display unit” that is “fully operable only when the detachable handset is docked thereto.”
'462 patent, col. 6 ll. 2–20. In other words, the device claimed by the '462 patent is formed by docking a smartphone
into  a  “shell”  comprising  a  display  and  keyboard,  where  the  overall  computing  power  of  the  device  resides  in  the
smartphone. “When mated with [the] docking display unit, the detachable handset becomes the controller for the entire ...
device.” Id. col. 5 ll. 16–20 When separated, the “detachable handset unit” functions independently with its own “video
interface” (display) and “data input interface” (keyboard). Id. col. 6 ll. 14.
------------- Layer 190  ---------------
Nelson teaches a “module” and a “base unit,” where “the customary functional components of a [personal computer]
are divided between the module and the base unit.” Nelson col. 2 ll. 22–24 (figure numbers omitted). In an embodiment
of Nelson, the processing power of the personal computer is allocated to the module, while the display and keyboard
are allocated to the base unit. See id. col. 2 ll. 24–50. In  *1332  Nelson's configuration, “[t]he module can be plugged
into a base unit, and then removed to relocate, store securely, or plug into a different base unit. But the module is not
functional as a standalone unit.” Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at 437. Nelson does not disclose use of a cellular
phone's processing power to operate a computer.
------------- Layer 191  ---------------
Smith teaches a “portable computer having an interface for direct connection to a portable telephone,” such that when
“[p]hysically and electrically connect[ed] ... the portable telephone serves as the portable computer's modem.” Smith, col.
11 ll. 48–67. But “[t]he telephone in Smith has no control over the portable computer and no way to present anything
on the display of the portable computer.” Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at 437.
------------- Layer 192  ---------------
This much of the prior art is largely undisputed. What the parties dispute is whether there was sufficient motivation
to modify the “portable telephone” in Smith to control Nelson's “base unit”—that is, whether “a person of ordinary
skill in the art at the time of the '462 patent would have been motivated to use Smith's detachable handset with Nelson's
docking display unit.” Id. In this scenario, the “detachable handset unit” recited in the asserted claims would correspond
to Smith's “portable telephone,” while Nelson's “base unit” would correspond to the “portable docking display unit.”
------------- Layer 193  ---------------
Motorola's expert testified that there was such motivation because Nelson “has only a single central processor ... and as
a consequence it is less expensive, it weighs less, and it consumes less power,” but “you can't use the portable module
to do anything unless it's docked with something,” while with Smith, on the other hand, “you have laptop functionality
and cellphone functionality, but you're paying for two central processors, and that means you dissipate more power, the
system overall is heavier, and it's more expensive. So the combination of Nelson and Smith has all of these advantages
without a shortcoming.” J.A. 1025. In opposition, IV's expert testified that there was no motivation because—mirroring
Motorola's expert—there was “[t]he extra cost from duplicating resources, the keyboard [or] the display,” and that the
combination would be “suboptimal.” J.A. 1043.
------------- Layer 194  ---------------
The  jury  apparently  credited  the  testimony  of  IV's  expert  over  Motorola's.  And,  in  denying  Motorola's  motion  for
judgment  as  a  matter  of  law,  the  district  court  observed  that  the  jury  reasonably  did  so  because  Motorola's  expert
“admitted  he  spent  little  time  preparing  his  report,  was  not  familiar  with  the  accused  products,  and  gave  arguably
conflicting and unclear testimony.” Intellectual Ventures, 176 F.Supp.3d at 439; J.A. 1029. Thus, because substantial

judgment of liability with respect to that patent. 1  I respectfully dissent from my colleagues' sustaining the validity of
the '144 and '462 patents, for I believe that the claims in suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in

THE '144 PATENT

A. Infringement of claim 41
------------- Layer 207  ---------------
I  agree  that  infringement  of  claim  41  of  the  '144  patent  was  not  established,  in  general  for  the  reasons  that  the
majority explains. Thus I join the holding of non-infringement of claim 41, for I agree that substantial evidence did not
support the jury's verdict. I write separately, however, to clarify the holding of Centillion Data Systems, LLC v. Qwest
Communications International, Inc., 631 F.3d 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011).
------------- Layer 208  ---------------
The district court correctly stated: “Centillion did not hold that the infringer ‘benefit’ from every single limitation. Rather
Centillion held that the user must ‘obtain benefit’ from the ‘system as a whole’ and its analysis of (and finding of) benefit
was not on a limitation-by-limitation basis.” Dist. Ct. Op. at 422. My colleagues “disagree,” Maj. Op. 1328, stating that:
------------- Layer 209  ---------------
Centillion and NTP held that to “use” something is to put it into service, which means to control
and benefit from it. And Centillion explicitly added that, to use a claimed system, what must be
“used” is each element. From those two propositions, it follows that, to use a system, a person must
control (even if indirectly) and benefit from each claimed component.

Id. (citations and parenthetical omitted).

court's statement of Centillion was not in error. Centillion did not establish a new requirement for infringement whereby a

user must benefit from every element of the system. Centillion held that “[b]y causing the system as a whole to perform this
processing and obtaining the benefit of the result, the customer has ‘used’ the system under § 271(a).” 631 F.3d at 1285.
------------- Layer 216  ---------------
To infringe a claim, every element of the claim (or its equivalent) must be practiced; but the benefit a user receives flows
from the claimed system as a whole. It is not a necessary element of proof of infringement, to require proof of benefit
from each element and limitation of the claim. The district court correctly so recognized.
------------- Layer 217  ---------------
It is of course required that for infringement every element of the claim must be practiced. However, Centillion does
not require a showing of individual benefit from every separate element that is included in a claim. See Centillion, 631
F.3d at 1285 (“By causing the system as a whole to perform this processing and obtaining the benefit of the result, the
customer has ‘used’ the system under § 271(a).”).
------------- Layer 218  ---------------
This definition of “use” properly captures the scope of infringement for which Centillion stands. It cannot be that a
person might be found liable for infringement when the last element of the claimed system does not accomplish the
primary purpose of the invention, that is, sending a multimedia text to another. Under Centillion, “use” by a party is
properly defined  *1334  as occurring when “but for the customer's actions, the entire system would never have been put
into service,” and each claimed component is placed in service on the party's behalf. Id.
------------- Layer 219  ---------------
Centillion conforms to precedent; the change imposed by my colleagues is unsupported by law. Infringement in this case
is a simple determination of whether the Motorola system practices all of the elements of claim 41, not whether the user
obtains a benefit from each of the elements of claim 41. The discussion of whether the user benefits from the system's
“generat[ing] a delivery report,” as claim 41 requires, is not the reason infringement is not present. The proper analysis
is whether the system is acting at the behest or control of Motorola if a delivery report is generated.
------------- Layer 220  ---------------
It is not disputed that all elements of the claim are not used by or attributable to Motorola. There was not substantial
evidence  that  Motorola  intended  the  generation  of  the  delivery  report  to  occur,  nor  was  there  substantial  evidence
Motorola received a benefit from the report's generation. Thus I concur in the holding of non-infringement of claim 41,
for it was not shown that Motorola's “use” of the accused system practiced every element of claim 41.
------------- Layer 221  ---------------
B. Validity of claim 41
------------- Layer 222  ---------------
At the trial Motorola argued that claim 41 was invalid for obviousness in view of the Overend reference taken with the
Micali reference.
------------- Layer 223  ---------------
The panel majority states that substantial evidence supports the finding “that Overend's ‘Receive Mode’ did not satisfy
the ‘irrespective of user action’ limitation of claim 41.” Maj. Op. ––––. However, the district court correctly construed
the claims to require that a file is received “irrespective of user action,” as long as “the user need not log-in to a server
and download the selected file.” J.A. 379. As the majority notes, “Motorola's expert testified that the ‘Receive Mode’ of
Overend's software allowed a user to receive files without having to ‘log in’ or ‘download’ files.” Maj. Op. 1327. There
is no indication that IV's expert testified to the contrary, although IV's expert offered the opinion that “ ‘Receive Mode’
was not equivalent to receiving files ‘irrespective of user action.’ ” Id.
------------- Layer 224  ---------------
IV's argument regarding “Receive Mode” is flawed, for claim 41 does not require the receipt of files to be instantaneous
or as they are sent; nor does the claim exclude queuing files in the network for later delivery. The claim limits precisely
what the district court construed the claim to limit: a “user need not log-in to a server and download the selected file.” It
is this user action that is not permitted to be read into the claim. Allowing the device to receive any queued or subsequent
real-time messages is precisely within the scope of receiving files “irrespective of user action.”

The Overend reference meets the “irrespective of user action” limitation. Thus all of the elements of claim 41 are shown
in Overend, with the exception of the authenticating step. But Micali teaches the authenticating step, describing “an
electronic communications method between a first and second party, with assistance from at least a trusted party ... in
which the first party has a message for the second party.” Micali, col. 3 ll. 54–58.

Micali further teaches embodiments in which the second party sends a “receipt” to the trusted party, and where the
trusted party sends a receipt to the first party. Id. col. 7 ll. 4–16; col. 12 ll. 5–32. Based on these teachings, Motorola's
expert testified that Micali's trusted party and exchanging of receipts satisfied the “authenticating device” limitations of
claim 41. The combination  *1335  of Overend and Micali shows all of the elements of claim. A person of skill in the
field of the invention would have found the combination obvious.

Although my colleagues state that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Motorola's] expert and credit [IV's] expert,” Maj. Op.
at 1327 (alterations in original), the court's obligation is to assure that questions of law are correctly decided, and that
for factual disputes, substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the legal conclusion. The question of law is
whether a person of ordinary skill in this art would deem it obvious to combine an authenticating step as in Micali, with
the process of Overend. See 35 U.S.C. § 103 (whether “the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented
and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made
to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.”).
------------- Layer 231  ---------------
Obviousness is determined based on the teachings in the prior art, and whether it would have been obvious to select and
combine these teachings. See In re Merck & Co., Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (“Non-obviousness cannot
be established by attacking references individually where the rejection is based upon the teachings of a combination
of references.”); In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d 1322, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“[T]he test for obviousness is what the combined
teachings of the references would have suggested to those having ordinary skill in the art.”).
------------- Layer 232  ---------------
Overend shows “transmit[ting] to an authenticating device of the communications network, the delivery confirmation
message.” '144 patent, col. 46 ll. 1–2 (claim 41); see Overend, col. 5 ll. 42–47. Micali shows the “authenticating device
of the communications network.” '144 patent, col. 46 ll. 1–2 (claim 41); see Micali, col. 3 ll. 54–58 (providing for “an
electronic communications method between a first and second party, with assistance from at least a trusted party ... in
which the first party has a message for the second party”); see also Smith cross-examination, J.A. 838, 1180:17–20 (“Q.
And you agree that the Micali reference shows a messaging system where the desire is to authenticate messages between
parties that maybe don't trust each other; right? A. Yes.”).
------------- Layer 233  ---------------
Overend similarly teaches “wherein the authenticating device is configured to: generate a delivery report that indicates a
delivery event and a time of the delivery event,” with Micali teaching the authenticating device in the claim element. '144
patent, col. 46 ll. 13–16; see Overend, col. 5 ll. 42–47; Micali, col. 3 ll. 54–58; see also J.A. 1219, Fig. 7b (Overend teaching
a “transfer log” with date/time stamps of transmission and receipt of a file); J.A. 741, 796:9–797:4 (Overend also teaching
a “delivery report[,] the delivery event[,] and the time of the delivery event”). The testimony of Dr. Martin Rinard, that
“the only limitation that Overend does not disclose is the third-party authenticating device,” and that “Micali discloses
the third-party authenticating device missing from Overend” remains undisputed. Dist. Ct. Op. at 429 (characterizing
Rinard's testimony).
------------- Layer 234  ---------------
Applying law and precedent, the combination of Overend and Micali renders claim 41 obvious. First, “when a patent
claims a structure already known in the prior art that is altered by the mere substitution of one element for another
known in the field, the combination must do more than yield a predictable result.” KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550
U.S. 398, 416, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). And second, “[w]hen a patent simply arranges old elements with
each performing the same function it had been known to perform and yields no more than one would expect from such
an arrangement, the  *1336  combination is obvious.” Id. at 417, 127 S.Ct. 1727 (internal quotation marks and citation

omitted). The Court explained that “a court must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior
art elements according to their established functions.” Id.
------------- Layer 239  ---------------
In light of the evidence, no reasonable jury could have found claim 41 to be nonobvious. There is not substantial evidence
that a receipt confirming delivery is not a delivery confirmation message as in the prior art, especially given the express
teachings of Micali's authenticating device. A “patent for a combination which only unites old elements with no change
in their respective functions ... obviously withdraws what already is known into the field of its monopoly and diminishes
the resources available to skillful men.” Id. at 415–16, 127 S.Ct. 1727 (quoting Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co. v. Supermarket
Equip. Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152–153, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950)).
------------- Layer 240  ---------------
Thus I must, respectfully, dissent from my colleagues' ruling sustaining the validity of claim 41.

THE '462 PATENT
------------- Layer 242  ---------------
On  the  evidence  presented,  no  reasonable  jury  should  have  found  the  claimed  subject  matter  of  the  '462  patent
nonobvious. The claims are for a portable telephone handset combined with a docking station, for which the computer
functions are provided by the handset. My colleagues agree that the issue is “whether a person of ordinary skill in the
art at the time of the '462 patent would have been motivated to use Smith's detachable handset with Nelson's docking
display unit.” Maj. Op. 1332. This motivation is provided in the cited references themselves.
------------- Layer 243  ---------------
The  '462  patent  explains  that  its  inventors  did  not  invent  portable  telephone  handsets,  did  not  invent  computerized
portable telephone handsets, and did not invent docking stations for computer-bearing or computer-directed modules.
See '462 patent, col. 1 l. 40–col. 2 l. 8. The '462 patent further states that “components used in device 10 can be similar to
those employed by traditional computing devices, communication devices, and entertainment devices.” See '462 patent,
col. 5 ll. 38–40.
------------- Layer 244  ---------------
The combination of a portable telephone with a dock is shown by Smith, and the combination of a dock with a computer
module is shown by Nelson. The combination that is described and claimed in the '462 patent is a portable telephone
having  a  computer,  and  when  docked,  the  docking  station  uses  the  telephone's  computer.  Nelson  shows  a  portable
computer, and a docking station that uses the PC's computer. Smith shows a portable telephone that docks with a docking
station that provides the computer module. The '462 patent shows a portable telephone having a computer, that docks
with a docking station that uses the telephone's computer.
------------- Layer 245  ---------------
As computer-fitted telephones became available, it was obvious to combine that telephone with the dock of Nelson,
recognizing Smith's combination of telephone and dock. Nelson discusses the “certain advantages over the other” of
portable and desktop PCs, “past” “attempts to combine the functions” of both, and states the “need for a system which
provides the advantages of both portable PCs and desktop PCs.” Col. 1 ll. 5–35. Smith remarks that “[t]he demands of
modern life require ... people to carry at least one electronic device to perform their daily work.” Col. 2 ll. 15–18. Smith
refers to the “dual problems of mobility and portability associated with using a portable telephone in combination with
a portable computer.” Abstract.
------------- Layer 246  ---------------
The  '462  patent,  benefitting  from  the  discovery  by  others  of  a  telephone  that  is  *1337   also  a  portable  computer,
simply  combines  this  device  with  a  docking  station,  as  shown  by  Nelson  for  docking  a  computer  module.  The  '462
combination of a portable telephone/computer with a docking station is the obvious combination of known devices for
their known purposes. See, e.g., J.A. 1025 (Motorola's expert discussing the advantages and disadvantages of Nelson
and Smith, individually, and concluding that “the combination of Nelson and Smith has all of these advantages without
a shortcoming”).

------------- Layer 250  ---------------
The majority observes that the parties' expert witnesses offered conflicting opinions as to what was obvious, and the
majority states that “[t]he jury apparently credited the testimony of IV's expert over Motorola's.” Maj. Op. 1332. Perhaps
so. However, the issue is not credibility of witnesses; the issue is whether substantial evidence supports the jury's decision,
taking into account the entirety of the record, and evidence that both supports and detracts from the decision. Universal
Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 487–88, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).
------------- Layer 251  ---------------
The question of obviousness is “whether a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the '462 patent would have
been motivated to use Smith's detachable handset with Nelson's docking display unit.” Maj. Op. 1332 (internal quotation
marks omitted). This ultimate inquiry is a question of law, and requires objective determination.
------------- Layer 252  ---------------
The  record  does  not  contain  substantial  evidence  supporting  the  majority's  conclusion  that  it  would  not  have  been
obvious to use the known computerized handset in the known docking station. The combination of the Nelson and Smith
references shows every element of the claims at issue in the '462 patent, used in the same manner, for the same purpose,
as in the '462 patent. See In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d at 1333 (“[T]he test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of
the references would have suggested to those having ordinary skill in the art.”). The motivation to combine the known
portable computerized telephone with the known docking station is provided by the references themselves, as discussed
above. The court's contrary conclusion is not supported by evidence.
------------- Layer 253  ---------------
Thus I respectfully dissent from the ruling that the '462 patent is not invalid on the ground of obviousness.

Motorola further argues that IV's expert testified that claim 41 covers long-term or permanent storage. Assuming that this
characterization of the expert's testimony is accurate, it is irrelevant because the question of claim construction here is resolved
by intrinsic evidence. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1318 (“[A] court should discount any expert testimony that is clearly at odds
with the claim construction mandated by the claims themselves, the written description, and the prosecution history, in other
words, with the written record of the patent.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
In light of our disposition, we need not address whether substantial evidence supported IV's alternative argument to the jury
that Overend and Micali failed to teach or render obvious “an authenticating device ... configured to ... generate a delivery
report that indicates a delivery event and a time of the delivery event.” '144 patent, col. 46 ll. 1–17. See Beckman Instruments,
Inc. v. LKB Produkter AB, 892 F.2d 1547, 1550–51 (Fed. Cir. 1989); see also, e.g., Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 386 F.3d
21, 29 (1st Cir. 2004); E. Trading Co. v. Refco, Inc., 229 F.3d 617, 621 (7th Cir. 2000).
See J.A. 620 (“[I]f you look also at the first phone, it actually just told me that [the] message ... had been received.”).
This  case  does  not  involve  a  situation  where  a  customer  simply  elects  not  to  take  advantage  of  a  known  and  available
functionality.
With respect to claim 10 only, Motorola relied on the combination of Nelson, Smith, with yet a third reference, U.S. Patent
No. 5,798,733 (“Ethridge”).
