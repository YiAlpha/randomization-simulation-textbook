       " \"O'Malley, Circuit Judge, with whom Newman and Reyna, Circuit Judges, join, dissents from the denial of the petition\\nfor rehearing en banc.\\nThe panel majority in this case held that the district court erred by adopting a plain-and-ordinary-meaning construction\\nfor several non-technical terms, and by purportedly allowing the parties' experts and counsel to make arguments to the\\njury about what those simple terms mean. See NobelBiz, Inc. v. Glob. Connect, L.L.C., 701 Fed.Appx. 994, 997–99 (Fed.\\nCir. 2017). I agree with Judge Newman, who dissented from that holding, that the majority erred by turning what is\\nfundamentally  *1327  a factual question for the jury regarding whether the accused systems and features infringe the\\npatent claims into a legal one for the court—and ultimately this court—to resolve. 1  See id. at 999–1001 (Newman, J.,\\ndissenting). And, by relying on O2 Micro International Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Technology Co., 521 F.3d 1351 (Fed.\\nCir. 2008), to support its holding, the majority has added to the growing confusion regarding the scope of that decision.\\nIn the nearly ten years since O2 Micro issued, this court has stretched its holding well beyond the factual circumstances\\nat issue there. In so doing, we have caused unnecessary difficulties for district courts, which must manage these already\\ndifficult-enough cases, and have intruded on the jury's fact-finding role. It is time we provide much-needed guidance en\\nbanc about O2 Micro's reach. I dissent from the court's order declining the opportunity to do so in this case.\\n\",\n",
       " \"O2 Micro involved technology related to DC-to-AC converter circuits for controlling the amount of power delivered\\nto cold cathode fluorescent lamps used to back-light laptop screens. Id. at 1354. During the claim construction phase\\nof the case, the parties presented a clear dispute to the district court regarding the meaning of the term “only if” in the\\nclaim limitation “a feedback control loop circuit ... adapted to generate a second signal pulse signal for controlling the\\nconduction state of said second plurality of switches only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold.”\\nId. at 1356, 1360–61. The plaintiff asserted that the claims would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to\\nonly apply to “the steady state operation of the switching circuit,” while the defend-ants argued that the claims apply\\nat all times, with no exception. Id. at 1360. Thus, the parties disputed “not the meaning of the words themselves, but\\nthe scope that should be encompassed by th[e] claim language.” Id. at 1361. The district court acknowledged the parties'\\ndispute but declined to resolve it, giving the term a plain-and-ordinary-meaning construction instead. Id. This left the\\nparties to argue about claim scope to the jury. See id. at 1362 (“O2 Micro also brought the inventor of the patents-in-\\nsuit to testify regarding the meaning of ‘only if’[.]”).\\n\",\n",
       " 'The technology at issue here, by contrast, is much different, and, in fact, simpler. The patents relate to a method for\\nprocessing a communication between a first party and a second party. See NobelBiz, 701 Fed.Appx. at 996. The terms\\nat issue—“replacement telephone number,” “modify caller identification data of the call originator,” and “outbound\\ncall”—are less technical than the term at issue in O2 Micro. And, at least for two of those terms, the parties did not dispute\\nhow a skilled artisan would understand their scope. Instead, the parties disputed only whether a formal construction\\nwas required. See id. Finally, the expert testimony in this case reveals that neither expert opined specifically about the\\nmeaning of the claim terms, nor did they contend that the terms have complex or technical meanings to one of skill in the\\nart. The experts merely expressed their own views about whether the allegedly infringing systems read on those terms.\\nThis case is therefore distinguishable from O2 Micro.\\n',\n",
       " \"Beyond this case, O2 Micro has caused difficulties for courts and litigants alike. O2 Micro's general rule is easy enough to\\nstate in the abstract: “When ... parties raise an actual dispute regarding the proper scope of the [ ] claims, the court, not the\\njury, must resolve that dispute.”  *1328  O2 Micro, 521 F.3d at 1360. We have not articulated, however, what constitutes\\nan “actual dispute” in this context. While we expect district courts to distinguish bona fide infringement arguments from\\nthose masquerading as claim construction disputes, we have not provided the lower courts with effective guidance to do\\nso. As a result, courts have struggled to strike the delicate balance between ensuring that they do not permit the jury to\\ndetermine claim scope, on the one hand, and ensuring that they do not encroach upon the constitutionally man-dated\\nfunction of the jury to find facts, on the other.\\n\",\n",
